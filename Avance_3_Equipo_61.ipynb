As usual, today\\u2019s meeting will be conducted as a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, and I\\u2019ll need a motion from a Board member to close the meeting. So moved. Second? Second. Without objection. Before turning to the formal agenda, I\\u2019d like to note that there will be a reception and dinner this evening, beginning at 5:00 p.m., in the West Court Caf\\u00e9. Let\\u2019s turn to our first agenda item, and we\\u2019ll turn to Simon and Lorie for the Desk report. In addition to the usual material, there will be a discussion of the background memo reviewing options on realigning the level of the IOER rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate. We\\u2019ll also discuss the annual swap line renewals. Over to you. 1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the intermeeting period, broad measures of financial conditions tightened somewhat further from their recent record post-crisis accommodative levels. U.S. equity prices are lower, the U.S. dollar is modestly stronger, and nominal U.S. Treasury yields have risen to multiyear highs. As reflected in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, this is true for both financial conditions indexes that allow for the recent widening in money market spreads, such as Bloomberg\\u2019s, and those that do not, such as the indicator produced by Goldman Sachs. I will begin the briefing by discussing the factors that have affected asset prices over the intermeeting period. None of these factors appears to have caused market participants to shift their expectations regarding the path of monetary policy materially. I will then take stock of what higher term money market rates might mean for financial conditions. I will conclude with a few updates on operational matters. 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). May 1\\u20132, 2018 5 of 185 Lorie will continue the briefing with a focus on developments in overnight money markets. The S&P 500 index declined roughly 2 percent over the intermeeting period and remains 7 percent below the all-time nominal high reached in late January. The dark blue line in the top-right panel shows that U.S. equity market-implied volatility remains elevated relative to levels seen for much of last year, though far below the extreme levels reached in early February. Desk contacts have cited several factors as contributing to higher equity market volatility over this intermeeting period than most of the past year. One is uncertainty regarding the outlook for trade relations between the United States and other major economies, particularly China. Another has been an increase in the perceived risk that some of the S&P\\u2019s largest technology companies\\u2014the so-called FAANG stocks\\u2014might in the future face additional government oversight, which could have negative implications for those companies\\u2019 earnings. Another factor reportedly contributing to recent asset price movements is foreign economic data signaling some moderation in global real growth momentum. As Beth Anne will discuss in her briefing, since early February economic data across most major foreign advanced economies have been disappointing compared with market expectations, while U.S. economic data have generally come in closer to market expectations over the same period. The effect of these factors on implied asset market volatility outside the equity market appears limited so far, as shown by the U.S. rates and developed and emerging market currency series in the top-right panel. Additionally, we continue to hear that recent price trends and levels of volatility in U.S. equity markets have not been sufficient to cause the bulk of the largest quantitative investment strategies\\u2014 such as trend-following commodity trading advisors and risk parity\\u2014to adjust their long-equity positions significantly. As we reported last cycle, an adjustment of this kind could lead to more severe risk asset price declines and greater spillovers. Last week, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield exceeded 3 percent for the first time since 2014, with the most recent move up largely accounted for by an increase in breakeven inflation rates. Contacts attributed the rise in inflation compensation to the continued firming in realized U.S. inflation data, as well as the roughly 10 percent rise in crude oil prices over the period, this rise being in part the result of geopolitical concerns. Yields in other advanced economies did not move higher with U.S. yields. This difference reflected the aforementioned weaker-than-expected foreign economic data and the perceived potential for this to delay the process of monetary policy normalization by foreign central banks, as detailed in the middle-left panel. The rise in U.S. yields to multiyear highs coincided with a slight rebound in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar over the intermeeting period, with the broad trade- May 1\\u20132, 2018 6 of 185 weighted index rising about \\u00bd percent. As shown in the light blue bars of the middleright panel, the U.S. dollar\\u2019s appreciation over the period was pronounced against more volatile emerging market currencies, such as the Brazilian real, which have in the past exhibited particular sensitivity to increases in U.S. Treasury yields. Many EM equity price indexes also declined sharply during the intermeeting period. With regard to U.S. policy expectations, as shown in the bottom-left panel, recent developments have had little effect on the market- and survey-implied paths of Fed policy. No rate hike is expected at this meeting, and a 25 basis point increase in the fede funds target range at the June meeting is almost fully priced into futures contracts. Looking further out, there is still a substantial difference between modal and mean expected paths of the federal funds rate, with mean paths, such as those reflected in the Desk survey and market prices, implying little further tightening after this year. Thomas will further discuss the flatness of the curve in his briefing. More broadly, despite ongoing changes to the composition of the FOMC, Desk survey respondents characterized the Committee\\u2019s communications over the intermeeting period as clear and consistent. When asked to rate the effectiveness of Federal Reserve communications provided since the Desk\\u2019s survey in March, respondents assigned the second-highest rating since the introduction of Chairs\\u2019 press conferences. Although expectations of the federal funds rate path are little changed over the intermeeting period, most short-term funding rates continue to trade a good deal above the corresponding expected average level of the effective federal funds rate. As shown in the bottom-right panel, the spread between three-month LIBOR and equivalent-tenor expected future federal funds rates, as measured by overnight index swaps, or OIS, is near its highest level since 2009. Recall that, in the Desk\\u2019s March surveys, when asked to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the elevated level of the three-month LIBOR\\u2013OIS spread, on average, respondents assigned the highest importance to Treasury bill issuance, followed by repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinational corporations. The LIBOR\\u2013OIS spread has narrowed slightly from its peak in early April, coincident with a partial retracement of the Q1 surge in U.S. Treasury bills outstanding. However, the narrowing has been smaller than some anticipated. Many attribute this outcome to ongoing implications of foreign corporate earnings repatriation and the sweeping changes in the U.S. corporate tax system. Others are registering some puzzlement regarding the continued firmness in term rates relative to OIS. In the May Desk surveys, respondents, on average, continued to revise slightly higher their estimates of the U.S. fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP, as shown in the top-left panel of your second exhibit. The higher deficit is expected to be financed in May 1\\u20132, 2018 7 of 185 part by increased bill issuance and suggests that the LIBOR\\u2013OIS spread could remain elevated. While Lorie will discuss recent developments in bill issuance and its effect on overnight rates in a moment, I want to take stock briefly of what wider money market spreads might mean for financial conditions. First, it is important to note that, in our March Desk surveys, nearly all respondents rated bank credit risk as an unimportant factor in the widening of the LIBOR\\u2013OIS spread, a view we continued to hear from market contacts this period. Even so, the widening represented an unanticipated increase in borrowing costs. As shown in the top-right panel, the spread realized in mid-March exceeded what money market futures had priced in at the end of last year by 35 basis points. As discussed in the Tealbook, recent upward pressure on short-term funding rates does not appear to have appreciably affected the borrowing costs or capacity of most U.S. households and businesses. However, higher U.S. dollar funding costs directly affect offshore dollar markets. One place we have seen this effect recently has been in Hong Kong, whose local currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. With U.S. dollar LIBOR increasing, the spread between LIBOR and the Hong Kong interest rate, HIBOR, widened further, as shown in the blue line in the middle-left panel. This elevated differential in turn put downward pressure on the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar. The Hong Kong dollar reached the weak end of its convertibility band in mid-April, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\\u2014or HKMA\\u2014to intervene in FX markets to support its currency peg. From April 16 to April 20, the HKMA sold 6.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange reserves, reducing the aggregate balance of liquidity in the banking system about 30 percent, helping to narrow the LIBOR\\u2013HIBOR gap. Higher U.S. dollar funding costs should tighten financial conditions in Hong Kong under the exchange rate peg. More significant is the amount of offshore U.S. dollar debt linked directly or indirectly to LIBOR and other short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. As shown in the middle-right panel, the staff estimates that U.S. dollar bank loans (in U.S. dollars, not from U.S. banks) to non-U.S. residents that could be directly or indirectly affected by U.S. dollar LIBOR\\u2014the sum of the three columns in the panel\\u2014totals more than $10 trillion, a significant portion of which is in developing economies. The staff will be monitoring for any indications of stress associated with the increase in dollar rates either via an increase in the federal funds rate or a rise in LIBOR relative to OIS. I will conclude with updates on three operational matters. Although LIBOR rates have widened relative to OIS, the cost of dollar funding via the FX swap market has increased by less because of reduced foreign demand for both U.S. dollar funding and hedging via the FX swap market. This has contributed to a decline to multiyear lows in the euro\\u2013dollar and dollar\\u2013yen three-month FX swap basis spreads, as shown in the bottom-left panel. As reported in the appendix, recent usage of the standing U.S. May 1\\u20132, 2018 8 of 185 dollar liquidity swap lines has been relatively low, also consistent with a lack of bank credit risk being the source of the increase in LIBOR. Relatedly, as discussed in the memo sent to the Committee on April 18, Steve Kamin and I request that the Committee vote to renew the standing liquidity swap lines with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. We also ask that the Committee vote to renew the North American Framework Agreement and applicable related agreements, or NAFA arrangements, with the central banks of Canada and Mexico. Foreign central bank counterparts support the renewal of these arrangements. The swap lines promote financial stability and confidence in global funding markets in times of stress. Importantly, reauthorization does not constitute automatic approval of any request to use the lines. All drawings related to U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines are subject to the approval of the Chair, while all drawings on foreign currency liquidity swap lines, and those related to the NAFA arrangements, require FOMC approval. The FOMC may terminate participation in the liquidity swap lines and the NAFA arrangements at any time with six months\\u2019 written notice. If the Committee chooses not to renew its participation in the NAFA arrangements, the related agreements would cease when they are currently set to expire on December 12. Regarding the SOMA portfolio, the Desk continues to reinvest receipts of Treasury and agency security principal in excess of the Committee\\u2019s announced redemption caps. Market contacts have not reported any significant effect on Treasury yields or MBS spreads arising so far from the increase in caps. Reflecting the increase in caps and expected receipts of principal payments, the decline in securities holdings and reinvestment activity is accelerating. According to baseline projections, as of last week, SOMA MBS purchases will cease altogether later this year, as shown in the bottom-right panel. Of course, due to the prepayment option embedded in MBS, the pace of decline and the time when MBS purchases cease are highly uncertain and depend on the future path of interest rates, among other factors. And, even after initially ceasing, MBS paydowns could exceed the cap in some months as factors driving prepayments fluctuate for seasonal and other reasons. The staff will circulate a memo before the June meeting with a detailed analysis on how in the money MBS purchases will be after this summer and options for maintaining operational readiness. As planned, the New York Fed began publishing three new repo reference rates on April 3. Recall that the Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected the broadest of these rates, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Shortly after publication began, we received feedback noting that the bilateral repo volumes\\u2014a large component of the transactions included in SOFR\\u2014appeared to be higher than some had expected. Following a thorough review with the data provider, it was found that the provider incorrectly included forward-settling overnight Treasury repo transactions in the May 1\\u20132, 2018 9 of 185 source data transmitted to the New York Fed. The data provider addressed the problem within a few days. A summary of the small-value exercises conducted over the intermeeting period, along with a list of upcoming exercises, including a test TDF operation, is shown in the appendix. I will now turn the briefing over to Lorie. Thank you, Simon. I\\u2019ll start on exhibit 3 and highlight recent developments in money markets. Then I\\u2019ll discuss factors contributing to increases in the effective federal funds rate relative to the IOER rate and the top of the Committee\\u2019s target range and conclude with potential policy considerations that were outlined in a staff memo on this topic. As Simon noted in his discussion of LIBOR\\u2013OIS, the pace of Treasury issuance and stock of bill supply continue to be cited as dominant drivers of money markets. As shown by the dark blue line in the top-left panel, while net bill issuance fell over the intermeeting period, it is expected to pick up again, and the overall stock of bills outstanding is expected to remain significantly larger than it had been in recent years. At the same time, as illustrated by the light blue line, the spread between bill rates and comparable OIS rates has edged lower from its recent highs but continues to be tight by historical standards. Similarly, as shown by the light blue line in the top-right panel, the spread between overnight triparty repo rates and the overnight RRP offering rate remains elevated compared with last year. Looking ahead, the gray dashed line shows that, according to the Desk\\u2019s surveys, repo rates are expected to stay at this higher spread to the overnight RRP rate. Reflecting the attractiveness of bills and repo as investment alternatives, overnight RRP take-up remained very low over the intermeeting period, as shown by the middle-left panel. This was the case even over quarter-end, when take-up totaled only $33 billion, significantly lower than the average $345 billion in take-up on quarter-end dates over the past year. Quarter-end also saw more muted changes in unsecured markets than has been typical in recent years. In particular, as highlighted in the middle-right panel, the effective federal funds rate declined only 1 basis point compared with an average decline of 9 to 10 basis points on recent quarter-end months. We also observed a more muted decline in the effective rate on yesterday\\u2019s April month-end. Additionally, in a notable departure from past quarter-ends when volumes typically declined along with rates, federal funds volumes actually increased $14 billion on the March quarter-end. As you can see in the bottom-left panel, analysis by the staff suggests this was driven mostly by an increase in borrowing by banks primarily motivated by IOER arbitrage\\u2014that is, banks that borrow below IOER in order to deposit those funds in their Federal Reserve accounts and earn the spread\\u2014 and that these IOER arbitrage volumes typically decline on quarter-ends. May 1\\u20132, 2018 10 of 185 I should note that, in practice, it\\u2019s difficult to identify the underlying motivation for federal funds trades with precision, and banks may have multiple motivations for borrowing. The breakdown shown here is based on market outreach as well as staff analysis of trading activity using the detailed FR 2420 data. Although the classification is somewhat speculative, we think it can help the interpretation of recent market developments and may also provide insight into how federal funds activity might evolve. It\\u2019s not clear why arbitrage-related borrowing would have increased at the time of the March quarter-end, but it\\u2019s possible that the general decline in such activity over recent months might have lessened the need to pare back borrowing in order to reduce their balance sheets for quarter-end reporting. Indeed, as shown in the bottom-right panel, other than at quarter-end, federal funds volumes have fallen since late January, with most of the decline coming from firms we classify as borrowing for IOER arbitrage, represented by the light blue area. Meanwhile, volumes for firms that appear to borrow primarily for reasons other than IOER arbitrage, such as to manage funding needs or as a way of meeting their liquidity coverage ratios, have been relatively steady, as shown by the dark blue area. We think the broader reduction in federal funds transactions for IOER arbitrage is stemming from the fact that Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which provide about 95 percent of federal funds loans, cut back on federal funds activity and increased their investments in repo because of higher repo rates. Recall that a primary reason why the effective federal funds rate trades below IOER is because FHLBs can\\u2019t directly earn IOER. If more attractive alternative investments become available to the FHLBs, they become less willing to lend federal funds at low rates. In the top-left panel of your fourth exhibit, you can see that the volume-weighted median rate paid by federal funds borrowers motivated by reasons other than IOER arbitrage\\u2014again, in dark blue\\u2014is slightly higher and more variable than the median rate paid by those primarily motivated by IOER arbitrage. The rates for both groups have been increasing lately. This may be because of FHLBs negotiating higher federal funds rates across all types of borrowers. The top-right panel puts the recent moves in volumes and rates together and shows that the effective federal funds rate\\u2014the volume-weighted median across all borrowers\\u2014has been ticking up within the target range since late last year, driving the spread between the effective rate and IOER from 9 basis points to 5 basis points, as shown by the red line. To provide more context on how the distribution of trades that underlie the effective rate has evolved, the middle-left panel shows the distribution of federal funds volumes at rates relative to IOER over a handful of different time horizons. On the far left, in light red, is the distribution for 2017. The other sets of circles show that the distributions during the weeks before and after the spread between the effective rate and IOER narrowed this year from 8 to 7, 7 to 6, and then 6 to 5 basis points this intermeeting period. As you can see, trading occurs at a wide range of May 1\\u20132, 2018 11 of 185 rates, and the bulk of trading volumes occurs around the median, which has adjusted gradually. This may suggest that the risk of a sharp move in the spread between the effective rate and IOER may be low. That said, the distribution has become more dispersed, and we don\\u2019t know how it might evolve should volumes continue to decline and the spread to IOER continue to narrow. As I discussed earlier, spillover coming from higher repo rates appears to have been the main driver of the recent rise in the effective federal funds rate. An increase in the effective rate that is a result of FHLBs finding more attractive investment opportunities is not necessarily an indication of reserve scarcity, and, indeed, we don\\u2019t see any evidence yet of impending reserve scarcity. As we look ahead, however, a range of factors are likely to exert further upward pressure on the effective rate, including the ongoing normalization of the balance sheet and the resulting reduction in the supply of reserves. As shown in the middle-right panel, most respondents to the Desk surveys expected the spread between the effective rate and IOER to continue to narrow but for the effective rate to remain below IOER through the end of next year. However, a few respondents did expect the effective federal funds rate to exceed IOER in 2019. Survey respondents were also asked to rate the importance of various factors in influencing the change in the spread through 2019, as summarized in the bottom-left panel. Changes in reserve balances and Treasury supply dynamics received the highest rating on average, though, according to anecdotal reports, most market participants have not cited reserve scarcity as a factor for the recent narrowing. As shown in the bottom-right panel, reserve balances have not declined significantly over the past year, but declines are expected to accelerate as balance sheet normalization continues. While there is considerable uncertainty around this, the staff expect an overall gradual upward trend in the level of the effective rate relative to IOER, stemming in part from higher rates on other money market instruments, ongoing balance sheet normalization, and potential changes to FDIC assessment fees. Under this expectation, and taking into account potential upward pressure arising from other factors, your final exhibit outlines a few policy considerations that were discussed in the memo. First, the memo discussed a potential technical adjustment to the setting of administered rates relative to the target range: \\u201cSpecifically, lowering the interest rates on excess and required reserves\\u2014or IOR rates\\u2014to be 5 basis points below the top of the target range while keeping the ON RRP offering rate at the bottom.\\u201d By setting IOER below the top of the target range, you would make it possible for the effective federal funds rate to remain within the target range even if it moved above IOER. Second, the memo noted that such an adjustment could be made \\u201cin conjunction with an increase in the target range\\u201d\\u2014in which case the IOR rates would be increased by a smaller increment than the target range and the overnight RRP rate. May 1\\u20132, 2018 12 of 185 Alternatively, this adjustment could be made \\u201cat an FOMC meeting when there is no change in the target range, in which case the IOR rates would be reduced by 5 basis points.\\u201d Lowering the IOR rates at a nontightening meeting could help to signal that the adjustment is solely technical, aimed at realigning market rates with the target range to reduce the risk that the effective federal funds rate would move outside the target range. However, as this adjustment is expected to initially lower the effective federal funds rate up to 5 basis points, you might not like the optics of taking an action that deliberately lowers its policy rate during a tightening cycle. If this outcome were a concern, the adjustment could instead be made at the same time that the target range is increased. This approach could still be communicated as a technical adjustment and would have the advantage of moving all rates in a direction consistent with a firmer stance of policy. Third, the memo noted that \\u201cpolicymakers can communicate their anticipated action in advance of any adjustment through a discussion of the issue in the minutes.\\u201d Finally, the memo highlighted the consideration that \\u201cpolicymakers might wish to revisit the language in the Desk directive\\u201d at some point \\u201cto provide more clarity on when it would be appropriate for the Desk to conduct open market operations to keep the effective federal funds rate in the target range.\\u201d The current language could be read as directing the Desk to undertake open market operations in the event that the effective rate breaches the target range. However, in many circumstances in the current environment, policymakers might conclude that it would be more appropriate to adjust administered rates to move the effective rate back into the target range rather than conduct open market operations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That concludes our prepared remarks. We would be happy to take any questions. Thank you, Simon. Thank you, Lorie. Let\\u2019s start with general questions about the Desk briefing and hold off for a moment on comments and questions about the level of IOER relative to the federal funds rate target. Any general questions about the Desk briefing? [No response] If there are none, then let\\u2019s turn to questions and comments on options for realigning the level of the IOER rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate. Vice Chair. Thank you. I\\u2019m completely on board with what the memo was recommending. I do favor making the technical adjustment to push the effective federal funds rate down within the target range. I very much would prefer to do it at a time when May 1\\u20132, 2018 13 of 185 we\\u2019re actually raising interest rates rather than having this weird situation that we\\u2019re not making a change at the meeting but we\\u2019re seemingly lowering the IOER rate. So I would support doing this sooner rather than later. Assuming that we\\u2019re actually going to tighten monetary policy at the June meeting\\u2014 assuming that stays in train, not prejudging that\\u2014then I would prefer to do this at that time. I think there\\u2019s a pretty small risk of the federal funds rate trading above the range, but I prefer to take that small risk off the table completely. And with respect to the last issue about if the federal funds rate were to trade outside the range what would I like the Desk to do, I would much prefer to adjust the administered rates than have the Desk engage in open market operations. Thanks. President Harker. Thanks. I just want to add some thoughts of the Philadelphia team. We\\u2019ve been doing a lot of work. I know they\\u2019ve reached out to the Desk to talk. I just want to put some thoughts on the table not for immediate action, but maybe for some future action. With respect to federal funds rate trading near the top of the range, we worry about it to the extent that it increases the probability that the funds rate will systemically trade above the top of the target range, which is currently bounded, obviously, by the IOER rate. I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that it\\u2019s not an excessively likely event. But we should avoid its occurrence, because letting the funds rate depart from the targeted range would cast doubt on our ability to implement policy accurately. And I think that\\u2019s an important aspect of this. It may force us to adjust the IOER and the ON RRP rates reactively. The latter could be done at the Desk\\u2019s discretion, as was mentioned, but the former does require Board approval. It may also require frequent changes as conditions in money markets change. Operating in this manner would May 1\\u20132, 2018 14 of 185 involve a tremendous communications burden, and I think it would be very difficult for us to communicate. It would be definitely better to be proactive in this sense. The memo raises a number of important issues related to our operating procedures in general. The first is if regulatory and market forces make it increasingly difficult to operate a floor system, we may wish to reconsider a corridor system. Currently, the levels of excess reserves are just simply too large to operate policy in this way effectively. However, work jointly carried out by the Philadelphia and New York Fed economists indicate that the transition to the corridor environment could occur at fairly high levels of reserves\\u2014not as high as their current levels, but maybe higher than we have previously thought. The second is that if these same forces continue to erode the federal funds market, it may be desirable to carry out monetary policy by operating in a broader money market, for example, the overnight RRP market itself. That would require, in my mind, much more study and preparation, but perhaps we should start to put some careful work and thinking into that matter. So my inclination is to continue operating in the funds market. But, in order to guarantee an active market, we may eventually wish to change our operating regime to a corridor system. As the balance sheet continues to normalize, that decision will ultimately confront us. Fortunately, current conditions in the funds market appear to be manageable using the two instruments we have on hand, IOER and ON RRP, but with slight adjustment with where they are set. The current funds rate behavior seems to be driven by a run-up in government debt, which has raised rates on overnight repos, making them a more attractive asset for GSEs. With a lower supply of credit in the federal funds market, the effective funds rate has risen as well. The IOER rate may need to be set, as Vice Chairman Dudley and others have said earlier, a few basis points below the top of the target range. But I worry that reducing the IOER rate may shrink the May 1\\u20132, 2018 15 of 185 federal funds market further, as GSEs will face lower rates and banks will have smaller margins. One possibility that we\\u2019d like to put on the table would be to lower the ON RRP rate commensurately\\u2014a move that may help prevent a further decline in the volume of trades. As I mentioned, there may come a time when we will need to consider if it\\u2019s desirable to change the manner in which the Desk implements policy, but we are not there yet. So I am in favor of dropping the IOER rate 5 basis points at a time when we do raise the federal funds rate and indicating that this is a technical adjustment made to ensure that the federal funds rate trades near the midpoint of the target range and doesn\\u2019t exceed the top of the target range. It may be helpful if we also lower the overnight repo rate 5 basis points. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Bostic. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I actually am going to start where I was going to end. I agree with President Harker in the sense that I think it\\u2019s useful to have a conversation about whether we use a floor or corridor framework. And I\\u2019m looking forward to having more conversations on that. I will say, for the Atlanta team, that this memo left us confused, and then it left me scared. I do want to say that, to me, the larger question here is that this doesn\\u2019t feel like an innocuous technical adjustment. It seems like we are using small actions to address something that\\u2019s fundamental in the nature of the policy, which is that current money market conditions will affect how we implement monetary policy, and as those conditions change, then we have to be reactive or proactive, however you want to put it. And the thing that scared me, and left me nervous, was the notion that money market conditions are going to change all the time. And without having a clear sense of what those dynamics are likely to be, it is not clear to me that whatever action we take today or in June or whenever we do will be sufficient to prevent us from May 1\\u20132, 2018 16 of 185 having to act again or again and again\\u2014which then has the potential to introduce a lot of questions about the stability of our policy and how we\\u2019re going to go about implementing it. I worry about the communications challenge of having a continual change in direction that happens as conditions evolve. For me, this is one of the reasons why I do think coming back to this framework question and trying to make sure that we have a framework that doesn\\u2019t look like we are tinkering at the structural level on a continuous basis is really important. A two-hander. There\\u2019s a broader question about whether we should really be targeting the federal funds rate as our key instrument of monetary policy when the federal funds market is becoming less and less significant. I think there\\u2019s a broader question of potentially saying, \\u201cLook, we\\u2019re not targeting the federal funds market, we\\u2019re targeting money market rates, and our tools are IOR and the overnight RRP rates.\\u201d That\\u2019s a broader question worth having a conversation about. I agree with that. Esther, then Lael, then Randy. I wondered if, either Vice Chairman Dudley or the staff would talk a little more about why they believe this should be a one-time adjustment, as opposed to having this happen again, and why they are averse to doing open market operations versus this option. Just to go back to the first question, I don\\u2019t think that lowering the IOER rate would change the probability of federal funds volume going away. I think the dynamics that are going to drive the federal funds volume to decline are irrespective of lowering IOER. I think those dynamics are about what is happening in money markets. And money market conditions May 1\\u20132, 2018 17 of 185 could evolve and could push the federal funds rate up to or slightly above the IOER rate if we make the change or if we don\\u2019t make the change relative to the target range. I think the key issue here is that it\\u2019s natural for the effective federal funds rate to potentially come to the IOER rate or slightly above, and I think the challenge was just that the ceiling of the target range was set at the IOER rate rather than being set slightly above it. If it\\u2019s set slightly above, then the federal funds effective rate can evolve naturally, slightly above or below, and you wouldn\\u2019t have to make any adjustments. So I think it was just because that initial setting was set at the IOER rate when technically rates should trade slightly above the IOER rate in a floor system. If we have the right setting of the range relative to the administered rates, it should be a one-time adjustment. And the open market operations issue is one of whether it would be effective in bringing the federal funds rate down. So, remember, we transact in the repo market only. And if we had a small amount of volume in the federal funds market and it was banks that were short of reserves, it\\u2019s possible it would filter through to them. But, with $2 trillion of reserves in the system, you\\u2019ve got to ask, why hasn\\u2019t the supply of reserves filtered through to them at that point? Adding a typical open market operation\\u2014it might be $8 billion in the old style\\u2014is very small percent, and you could try and do open market operations of a larger amount. However, I\\u2019m concerned our understanding of how to do an open market operation of that amount, and counterparties\\u2019 willingness to be involved, would be something we\\u2019d have to learn over time. So the first time we did it, we might look quite clumsy in trying to achieve the outcome that we want. Thanks. Governor Brainard. May 1\\u20132, 2018 18 of 185 Yes. I think going back to our discussions leading up to the Normalization Principles and Plans that we released in September of 2014 and the addendum that we released in March of 2015, there was a lot of discussion recognizing that it was likely the effective federal funds rate would move closer to the top of the target range. And, in fact, that was viewed as something that would be a sign that we were establishing effective monetary policy control with the new framework. I appreciate the staff alerting us to the likelihood that as part of that process the effective funds rate could actually move to or above the top of the range in a way that I think would be confusing to the public. And by alerting us to it early, it provides us a useful opportunity to address the risk in advance. The proposal to reduce the level of the interest rate on reserves 5 basis points below the top of the target range seems like a sensible approach to me on its face, and I favor our taking action proactively. And I think it will be very useful to provide a window into our thinking in advance, through the description of today\\u2019s discussion in the minutes of this meeting. Of the two options that are presented\\u2014either lowering the interest rate on reserves at a meeting when there is no adjustment to the target federal funds rate or at a meeting when the entire target range is shifted upward\\u2014I prefer the latter. Otherwise, as the memo points out, the Committee could be misinterpreted as introducing a small rate cut in an environment in which it has led the public to expect continual gradual increases in the path of rates. By contrast, at a meeting with an increase in the target range, it should be easier to explain to the public that this is a small technical adjustment. I presume the necessary change will entail a simple revision to the March 2015 addendum language in which we essentially said that we would set the IOR rate equal to the top May 1\\u20132, 2018 19 of 185 of the target range, and so we\\u2019ll need to adjust that. That said, I think once we move forward with this, the question that President Bostic and Vice Chairman Dudley have put on the table about whether we should continue to target the federal funds rate range\\u2014is an ongoing issue that I don\\u2019t think will be put to bed by this small technical adjustment. Thank you. Governor Quarles. I had not expected this discussion to be so interesting. [Laughter] But despite all of the interesting things that have been put on the table, I do think that this is a fairly technical adjustment. I support it being done. I support it being done sooner rather than later. I think that the explanations and response to President George\\u2019s questions actually were very helpful to me. I thought I understood it before. I now think I understand it better. As for whether it should be done at a meeting at which there\\u2019s a hike or a meeting at which there isn\\u2019t a hike, I actually think that the most important thing is that it should be done at a meeting where there\\u2019s a press conference in which the Chair can explain it. Now, in our current universe, that\\u2019s the same thing, and because I think that it should be done sooner rather than later, it will be the same thing. But the principal issue is that of communications, and I think this could be communicated when not accompanied by a rate hike, but it has to be communicated, and so I\\u2019m supportive of doing this soon and when the Chairman can talk about it. Thank you. President Mester. Thank you. I want to align myself with others who said that we should be thinking about the framework sooner rather than later. I think there are a lot of market participants who are interested in what our framework is going to be. May 1\\u20132, 2018 20 of 185 Regarding the technical adjustment, I\\u2019m okay with it. The memo laid out some reasons why you might want to do it when you\\u2019re raising rates, and I align myself with those. But another reason to do it at a meeting at which we\\u2019re going to raise the target range for the federal funds rate is a governance issue. I think it\\u2019s really important to underscore that point. What we\\u2019ve said in the past is true, that our monetary policy is set by the FOMC\\u2014by setting that target range\\u2014and then the IOER rate, which of course is a tool set by the Board of Governors, will be adjusted to get the funds rate within the target range. So I have a strong preference that we take advantage of that and underscore the governance. I guess I would be a little bit reluctant, perhaps, not to use open market operations for that reason. I would rather do that than adjust the IOER rate. But I do think that the broader question of what our ultimate framework is going to be is something that we need to think about. And I would rather we do it sooner rather than later, because I think there are a lot of issues involved that may seem like a technical discussion, but are more than a technical discussion. Thanks. Thank you. President Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I found the IOER memo actually very clear. I\\u2019m going to say very much the same things as the Vice Chair, Governor Brainard, and Governor Quarles said\\u2014I see the primary issue to be one of clearly and consistently demonstrating control of the effective funds rate. That is our target rate at the current time. The original design\\u2014a 25 basis point range bracketed by the rates on overnight reverse repos and IOER\\u2014served us extremely well in that regard. And, like Governor Brainard, I would also like to go back to those discussions in which we were very focused on making sure that we were communicating to the markets and to the public that we have control over short-term interest rates. That whole design, in the environment that we were in, was basically to guarantee May 1\\u20132, 2018 21 of 185 that we could show that we could raise rates when it was appropriate and control rates in a reasonable fashion. And it has been a complete success. As Governor Brainard pointed out, we also thought that the right way to set up these ranges or these relative positions of these administered rates would depend on market conditions and would evolve over time. So now, with the effective funds rate likely trading very high in the range for the foreseeable future and even in danger of reaching it, it\\u2019s eminently sensible to lower the IOER rate somewhat below the top of the range as suggested in the memo. Now, from a communications perspective\\u2014and I agree with everybody that this is probably the most important part\\u2014I do think this is easier done at a meeting when we\\u2019re raising the target range and when there is a press conference to describe this action. And I agree with President Mester about the importance of aligning, as we have, the idea that the FOMC is setting the policy rate and that the administered rates are set in order to achieve the FOMC\\u2019s decision. That\\u2019s what all this is about. The FOMC says we want the funds rate to trade in this range. These administered rates are set in a way that best achieves that consistently over time. To avoid a potentially confusing, unintended breach of the target range down the road, we should not delay taking this step too long. In particular, I think it makes sense to raise the rate on IOER 20 basis points in conjunction with our anticipated 25 basis point increase in the target range at our next meeting. Of course, this assumes that we don\\u2019t see a reversal in the pattern of the funds rate trading high in the range in the meantime. Again, it will be important to communicate to the public that this is a purely technical modification in the execution of our monetary policy framework, which we laid out in these earlier documents, and that additional modifications like this may be necessary as conditions in money markets evolve, especially in the context of a shrinking Federal Reserve balance sheet. In terms of which is the better tool to May 1\\u20132, 2018 22 of 185 achieve this goal of supporting the execution of monetary policy, I think that adjusting over time the administered rates is a more effective and less expensive way to do this than trying to use open market operations. The last thing I\\u2019ll just mention is that I don\\u2019t see this as something that we would be having to modify frequently. These changes in money market conditions are relatively slowmoving\\u2014I hope. [Laughter] But again, going back to our discussions of a few years ago, I think we understood that the success of this was going to see the funds rate trading at or a little bit above the IOER rate. And if you remember these discussions, it was somewhat surprising that this floor was as soft and permeable as it proved to be at the time. If you look at the Desk survey, I think market participants\\u2014and my own views are aligned with this\\u2014expect that, as we shrink the balance sheet and as other market conditions evolve, we may need to make one or two more of these adjustments. But, again, I see it as a predictable part of the execution of the policy we laid out back in 2015. Now, I, like others, will chime in that I do think it\\u2019s getting to be time for us to have that more significant, deeper discussion about the long-run policy implementation framework. But I view that as separate from this technical decision that really is just made in support of the execution of the framework that we are following now. Thank you. Thank you. President Evans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me add my agreement to pretty much everybody\\u2019s comments so far. I agree that we should make a technical adjustment in the IOER rate, and it would be best to do it at a time when we\\u2019re increasing the funds rate. For the target range, I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley\\u2019s comment that we should change the language of the Desk directive so that it points more toward changing rates rather May 1\\u20132, 2018 23 of 185 than open market operations. And I think that we should dust off the relevant analyses produced during the long-run framework discussion so that we could be better prepared if nonarbitrage trading in the funds rate market dominates too strongly, and we might have to revisit this framework. We should be proactive in that regard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Kashkari. Just a follow-up question. President Williams, you said in your comments that you support making this adjustment in June. I think you said \\u201cassuming it doesn\\u2019t reverse itself between now and then.\\u201d But what are the odds of that? Is it possible that a month from now, or three months from now, we\\u2019re going to regret having made this decision? So we started at 15 below. We\\u2019re 5 below. It hasn\\u2019t reversed itself so far. What Lorie was trying to point out is that some of the dynamics in the federal funds market do seem to be changing, so we\\u2019ve been looking at it each day. It came in at 169 basis points yesterday. That\\u2019s a monthly-end. That was a very small drop. It almost came in at 170 at that point. But in panel 21, we can attempt to show you that distribution of trading is moving up. Remember, the FHLB is at 95 percent of people selling into this market. And they\\u2019ve seen people prepared to pay very close to interest on reserves, so that bargaining power should stay there for a while. But there are other things that could happen in the regulatory environment. There are changes that might affect it. Most of what we had in the memo should really tighten the spreads, particularly the surcharge that they\\u2019re paying for the Deposit Insurance Fund. When that goes away, that would make big U.S. banks more competitive in the market. What\\u2019s the downside? If some of this stuff unwound unexpectedly, it wouldn\\u2019t really make a difference. We\\u2019d still be in the range. May 1\\u20132, 2018 24 of 185 Yes, I think it would because the overnight RRP has been a very solid floor. So if dynamics in the Treasury securities market were to take back all $500 billion of those bills, by way of example, those rates could come down, but the overnight RRP is still a very solid floor at the bottom. So it wouldn\\u2019t require any change. I think the issue we were just trying to deal with is that the federal funds rate should be, in theory, slightly above the IOER rate. And because of our financial system, that wasn\\u2019t the case, and so we\\u2019re just trying to create a little bit of room so that that could happen. Now, it is possible that if all of the IOER arbitrage trading went away, the federal funds market could be very, very small and idiosyncratic, and that rate could jump really high, well above the range. But in that world, you\\u2019d probably be thinking about the way you were communicating the monetary policy stance, because the federal funds market would be so small at that point. Thank you. President Rosengren. Yes. I would just like to follow up on Lorie\\u2019s last point. So if you look at figures 17 and 18, and you just take out the light blue so that all you have is the dark blue, it\\u2019s a market that basically doesn\\u2019t exist, and we\\u2019ve tied our monetary policy to it. And it\\u2019s a very small amount of funds that we\\u2019re talking about; the end-of-the-quarter volume would be very, very small. I have no objection to the technical adjustment, but I do think that we should be having a more fundamental discussion about what happens if the federal funds rate trades above the interest rate on excess reserves, and all of a sudden this arbitrage goes away, and now, really, it is the administered rates that are determining monetary policy. So I think it\\u2019s fine for May 1\\u20132, 2018 25 of 185 this set of meetings, but I think it\\u2019s a bigger problem, and we probably should have a broader discussion of it at a future meeting. President Bullard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with much of what has been said around the table. This was a constructed system in which we wanted to stick to the federal funds rate as the announced policy rate. As President Rosengren just pointed out, and others have, too, it\\u2019s a very thin market. And it was a difficult decision, I think, on the part of the Committee to stick with the funds rate, as opposed to going to some other rate as being the actual policy rate. But it\\u2019s a matter of tradition, and so that\\u2019s where we came down. I would take it as good news that it is trading closer to the IOER rate, because the soggy floor problem was the one we were trying to address. A simple thing to do that I haven\\u2019t heard mentioned here is that you could bring overnight RRP rate up closer to the IOER rate and have them all trade closer together. You could change the communication to say that this floor problem has gone away or, if it continues to go away, that we\\u2019re not as worried about that as we were in the past, and we don\\u2019t have this target range. And we\\u2019re not so concerned about exactly where the federal funds rate trades, because it\\u2019s a thin market, and it just trades somewhere around the IOER rate. That would be a perfectly fine way, in my mind, to run monetary policy. So there are a lot of options here. I have no problem with the technical adjustment. But as everyone has pointed out, there are a lot of issues here. Other comments or questions? [No response] I\\u2019ll say that I do agree that it will be appropriate the next time we raise the federal funds rate to raise the IOER rate 20 basis points, which will have been carefully signaled in the minutes of this meeting as a technical adjustment\\u2014a point that we\\u2019ll also stress when the increase happens. May 1\\u20132, 2018 26 of 185 Separately, I think, as is the case for a number of you, this memo and our discussion suggest that we probably should bring forward in time our discussion of a longer-run policy implementation framework\\u2014which I had been thinking wasn\\u2019t going to be 2018 business and was something for which we had plenty of time. Actually, if you look at the level of reserves toward the end of 2019, it really does get just above $1 trillion and in a range in which it could well be equilibrium. So I do think we will return to the longer-run framework discussion later this year or, at the absolute latest, early in 2019. Thanks for an interesting discussion. If there are no further questions or comments, I\\u2019m now going to ask for separate votes on the renewal of the NAFA arrangements and the liquidity swap arrangements. Of course, only current FOMC members may vote. So we\\u2019ll start with the NAFA arrangements, our standing swap lines with Canada and Mexico. Do I have a motion to approve? So moved. Any comments? [No response] All in favor? [Chorus of ayes] Any opposed? [No response] The renewal of the NAFA swap arrangements is approved. Now for renewal of the liquidity swap arrangements. Do I have a motion to approve? So moved. Any comments? [No response] All those in favor? [Chorus of ayes] Any opposed? [No response] The renewal of the liquidity swap arrangements is approved. Finally, we need a vote to ratify the domestic open market operations conducted since the March meeting. Do I have a motion to approve? So moved. May 1\\u20132, 2018 27 of 185 All in favor? [Chorus of ayes] Thanks very much. Next we will turn to the review of the economic and financial situation, including financial stability developments. Bill Wascher, would you like to start us off? 2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\u2019ll be referring to the materials in the packet you have titled \\u201cMaterial for Briefing on the U.S. Outlook.\\u201d In broad terms, the \\u201ctakeaway\\u201d coming from our April Tealbook projection is not much different from what we\\u2019ve been forecasting for a while. The economy is projected to expand at an above-trend pace over the next few years, supported by expansionary fiscal policy and solid foreign real GDP growth. Tighter monetary policy is expected to weigh on U.S. real GDP growth over time, but resource utilization is nonetheless projected to be very high at the end of the projection period, helping to keep inflation at your 2 percent target. The data that we have received since the March Tealbook remain consistent with this outlook. As you can see from panel 1 of your forecast summary exhibit, real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, though by a little less than we were expecting. The blue dot on the chart shows the BEA\\u2019s advance estimate, which we received after the Tealbook was closed. Its estimate, which is subject to revision, was 2.3 percent, about \\u00bd percentage point higher than our April Tealbook forecast but relatively close to what we were projecting in March. Regardless of the exact number, we continue to think that the deceleration in economic activity last quarter will prove to be transitory. In particular, the slowdown was concentrated in consumer spending, which had risen sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, likely boosted by replacement demand for motor vehicles and, more generally, a rebound in spending following the fall hurricanes. As a result, we expect to see real GDP growth pick back up to a 3 percent pace in the current quarter, which would put the pace of growth over the first half of the year at about 2\\u00be percent. Under our assumptions about potential output, this pace of first-half growth is sufficient to further widen the output gap and implies additional upward pressure on resource utilization. With regard to the labor market, the March employment report was not as strong as we had expected. The pace of payroll job gains slowed to 103,000, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent, which is where it\\u2019s been for the past several months. That said, payroll gains for the first quarter as a whole were solid, and the aggregate labor force participation rate\\u2014not shown\\u2014moved up a touch in Q1, which, taking into account its declining trend, points to some additional tightening along this margin of labor market slack. As a result, our overall assessment is that the labor market continued to tighten over the first three months of the year. 2 The materials used by Mr. Wascher are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). May 1\\u20132, 2018 28 of 185 We will receive the BLS\\u2019s April employment report this Friday. As you know, however, we have been using the real-time firm-level data provided to us by the payroll-processing firm ADP to help provide a more timely and independent read on one aspect of the state of the labor market, the pace of employment growth. In this regard, the thin black line in panel 2 plots the ADP-based estimate of private job gains using employment counts for the first three weeks of April. The current estimate for April, at just 78,000, is notably weaker than our Tealbook forecast, though, as shown by the blue line, a pooled estimate using a Kalman filter model downweights somewhat this low reading, even in the absence of the BLS data for April. I would also note that the April ADP estimate follows some unusually high readings around the turn of the year, and the average pace of job gains implied both by these data and by the BLS\\u2019s estimates in recent months remains well above the rate that we judge to be consistent with no change in resource utilization. Accordingly, with growth in overall economic activity expected to exceed its potential in the current quarter, we expect the unemployment rate to resume its downward trajectory in coming months. As you can see in panel 4, the recent behavior of the aggregate unemployment rate has been broadly mirrored by the unemployment rates for various racial and ethnic groups. Indeed, the jobless rates for blacks and Hispanics are now generally below those seen in 2000 and are near the lowest levels since the BLS began reporting unemployment rates for these groups in the early 1970s. That said, these rates\\u2014especially for blacks\\u2014remain noticeably above the unemployment rates for whites. Moving back up to the first panel: Our forecast of real activity over the medium term is just a shade weaker than the one we showed you in March, as we did take a little signal from the incoming data for the underlying trajectory of consumer spending. Nevertheless, real GDP is projected to increase at roughly a 2\\u00bd percent pace through 2019, supported importantly by fiscal policy\\u2014panel 5\\u2014before slowing to 2 percent in 2020, as further increases in the federal funds rate\\u2014panel 6\\u2014and a tightening in financial conditions more generally act to rein in spending and production. Hence, we continue to expect that real output growth will outpace potential growth\\u2014albeit to a diminishing degree\\u2014throughout the projection period. Accordingly, the unemployment rate\\u2014the black line in panel 3\\u2014levels out in 2020 at 3.3 percent, about \\u00bc percentage point higher than we were projecting in March. As we reported to you on Friday, information received after we closed the Tealbook projection had little net effect on our medium-term outlook. Although we carried forward some of the higher-than-expected level of activity indicated by the first-quarter GDP release, this effect was roughly offset by the appreciation of the dollar over the past week or so, which implies a slightly smaller contribution to GDP growth being made by net exports in the second half of this year and in 2019 than in our Tealbook forecast. In light of all of the changes in fiscal policy that have taken place over the past six months, I thought it might be interesting to take a step back and compare our current May 1\\u20132, 2018 29 of 185 fiscal assumptions with those made last September, when we first extended the medium-term forecast to include 2020. As shown by the blue bars in panel 5, at that time we had included a small placeholder to account for the possible enactment of an expansionary fiscal package, but nothing specific. As indicated by the black bars, however, the combination of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act, along with our assumption that the Congress will find a way to keep spending in 2020 from suddenly dropping back to the earlier budget caps, resulted in a much larger fiscal expansion than we had been assuming. There were other things going on as well, of course. But a relatively simple calculation suggests that the changes to our fiscal policy assumptions between September and now can account for most of the upward revision to the assumed baseline path of the funds rate shown in panel 6, which, as you know, we set by mechanically applying an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. Your next page of exhibits summarizes the inflation outlook. The recent data on PCE prices are consistent with our view that inflation was held down by transitory factors last year and will come in higher this year. As you can see from the black line in panel 7, according to the monthly PCE price data that we received yesterday, total PCE prices\\u2014the black line\\u2014rose 2 percent over the 12 months ending in March, with a corresponding increase in core PCE prices\\u2014the red line\\u2014of 1.9 percent. Both figures were basically in line with our April Tealbook estimates and represent a stepup of 0.3 percentage point from February, mainly reflecting the much-anticipated dropping out of last year\\u2019s low March monthly reading from the 12-month-change calculation. Looking ahead, we now expect the 12-month change in the core index to move just above 2 percent this summer and to remain in the neighborhood of 2 percent through the end of the year. Total PCE inflation is projected to reach 2\\u00bd percent briefly, boosted by some relatively rapid increases in consumer energy prices. We expect, however, that, by the end of the year, energy prices will have peaked and total PCE prices will be rising at about the same rate as the core index. Beyond the near term, our inflation projection is little revised since March. Core inflation\\u2014panel 9\\u2014is projected to edge up to 2.1 percent in 2019 and to remain at that level in 2020, as a further tightening of resource utilization and a gradual increase in underlying inflation offset the effect of an anticipated deceleration in core import prices. Total PCE price inflation\\u2014panel 8\\u2014is expected to run a touch below core inflation in 2019 and 2020, as a small projected decline in oil prices over the medium term feeds through into consumer energy prices. Finally, panel 10 shows four of the various measures of labor compensation growth that we follow, including our best guess\\u2014based on the advance NIPA data\\u2014 of what the BLS will report for first-quarter hourly compensation growth in Thursday\\u2019s Productivity and Costs release. On the whole, we see a bit of evidence that labor compensation growth is creeping up, though it\\u2019s hard to be too certain, considering how differently these various series can behave and how volatile they can be from year to year. We put the most weight on the ECI\\u2014the black line\\u2014in May 1\\u20132, 2018 30 of 185 part because it is less noisy than the other available measures. Last week\\u2014and after the April Tealbook was closed\\u2014we received the ECI for March, which came in at 2.8 percent on a 12-month-change basis, about \\u00bc percentage point higher than we had anticipated and \\u00bd percentage point higher than its year-earlier pace. The recent behavior of the ECI appears broadly consistent with our view that compensation growth is evolving about as one would expect, in a situation of an increasingly tight labor market, relatively well-anchored inflation expectations, and continued lackluster trend productivity gains. I\\u2019ll now turn it over to Beth Anne to talk about the international outlook. 3 Thank you. So it is just my luck to brief you on yet another holiday, May Day. In celebration of May Day, the traditional springtime festival, I bring you our benign foreign outlook. As presented in slide 1, we anticipate solid, broad-based foreign growth at close to 3 percent in the near term, edging down to potential. The strong performance in both the advanced and emerging market economies has been associated with a continued recovery in global trade from a middecade slump, importantly reflecting a resurgence in high tech and manufacturing. As May Day is also an international day honoring workers, in your next slide it seems only appropriate to acknowledge that abroad, as well as at home, the economic expansion is characterized by buoyant labor markets, with unemployment rates near or below pre-crisis lows. Furthermore, though the development is not spectacular, labor and total factor productivity\\u2014to the right\\u2014are turning up a bit, and wages are showing hints of life. That said, as discussed in slide 3, since your previous FOMC meeting, we have gotten indicators that make us wonder if the bloom is coming off the rose. PMIs, while still at levels indicating robust growth, turned down in the advanced foreign economies. And while it may be partially weather related, Q1 GDP data\\u2014including after the Tealbook closed\\u2014surprised us on the downside across the major AFE economies. More generally, vintages of our forecasts, shown to the right, reveal that the burgeoning pattern of upward revisions we saw last year, the green lines, seems to have been somewhat nipped in the bud so far this year. In contrast, our forecasts of oil prices and the dollar have been springing up of late. As seen in your next slide, continuing their climb since early 2016, oil prices jumped about 10 percent over the intermeeting period. Against a backdrop of strong global demand, the implementation of OPEC production quotas around the turn of last year and sustained compliance since\\u2014witness the step-down in Saudi Arabian production shown to the right in green\\u2014have provided a considerable boost to prices. More recently, uncertainty surrounding renegotiation of the Iran nuclear agreement and a flare-up in tensions elsewhere in the Middle East further boosted prices. In our forecast, prices generally decline, importantly reflecting resurgent U.S. production, 3 The materials used by Ms. Wilson are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). May 1\\u20132, 2018 31 of 185 the black line on the right. Indeed, the United States is on track to become the world\\u2019s largest producer of crude oil by the end of the year. As seen on your next slide, in part as a result of the rise in oil prices, AFE headline inflation has risen too, but core remains subdued, and we see only gradual progress to sustainably hitting 2 percent. In consequence, policy rates abroad, shown to the right, are likely to considerably lag policy rates in the United States. As for the dollar, the subject of your next slide, yes, we still expect it to strengthen. Much has been made of the weakening of the dollar last year despite U.S. monetary policy tightening, fiscal stimulus, and a strong U.S. economy. Our best guess is that the strength of the expansion abroad, reduced perceptions of downside risks, and the related anticipation of foreign monetary policy normalization help account for the dollar\\u2019s decline. Over the forecast, we expect relative surprises in monetary policy, shown to the right, to reassert themselves as driving forces, leading to mild dollar appreciation as markets are surprised by the run-up in U.S. policy rates in our baseline. Finally, I would be remiss if I left out the \\u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday!\\u201d portion of the briefing. [Laughter] Slide 7 presents our updated \\u201cInternational Financial Stability Matrix.\\u201d After reviewing conditions in 13 matrix countries across six risk categories, we assess the overall level of vulnerabilities as \\u201cModerate.\\u201d We have seen mild improvements in foreign financial vulnerabilities, reflecting robust global real GDP growth and a positive foreign economic outlook, but not by enough to change our country assessments. The market volatility earlier in the year has intensified focus on valuations globally. We find that \\u201cNotable\\u201d or \\u201cElevated\\u201d valuation pressures are common across more than half the countries. Corporate bond spreads are historically low in most countries, equity valuations are stretched in a number, and, for some, housing markets are quite tight. That said, the experience is not uniform, and continued easy financial conditions have not translated into an overall increase in leverage in the private nonfinancial sector. We also updated our \\u201cProminence of Risks Assessments,\\u201d the last column, which captures well-defined, near-term events that represent salient risks. Political uncertainty continues to contribute to the prominence of risks in countries such as Italy, Brazil, and Mexico. For China, our assessment in this category moved from \\u201cMedium\\u201d to \\u201cHigh,\\u201d reflecting the multiple potential paths to financial crisis due to the country\\u2019s elevated debt levels, particularly if current efforts to rein in credit growth misfire. In contrast, we have stepped down our concerns about risks on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to country-specific risks, this round we have added two global shocks to our prominence of risks. The first is the possibility of a sharp, widespread reversal in asset valuations, explored in the \\u201cGlobal Tightening Tantrum\\u201d scenario in the May 1\\u20132, 2018 32 of 185 Tealbook. The second is a broad move toward protectionist trade policies. It is on this risk that I will focus the remainder of my remarks. As discussed in slide 8, the past year or so has marked a significant shift in U.S. trade policy. The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the renegotiation of NAFTA and the Korean Free Trade Agreement, the high-profile safeguard tariffs on washing machines and solar cells, the imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports in the interests of national security, and proposed section 301 actions against Chinese imports and investment together signify a pivot to a more protectionist policy stance. The table provides some background on a number of these recent actions. Importantly, although there has been much back-and-forth, the actual measures, as currently enacted or as originally proposed, target a small fraction of our nearly $2\\u00bd trillion in goods imports, assuming, as we do, that the ongoing NAFTA negotiations do not result in sizable tariff increases. Thus, the effect on output and inflation in our forecast is minimal. As discussed on your next slide, however, we have seen a willingness to escalate both rhetoric and responses that has the potential to shake market confidence and increase investor uncertainty. The left chart presents an index of news searches on words related to trade policy and shows a staggering rise in references, capturing the attention on, and uncertainty about, trade policy of late. Because of the quickly changing landscape, it has been difficult to identify a sustained market reaction to recent trade developments. In the past, we have found evidence of a positive relationship between general economic policy uncertainty and the VIX. And, as Simon has suggested, trade policy uncertainty may be playing a role in higher volatility currently. In addition, although it is too early to see these concerns manifest in hard data, increasing references to \\u201cuncertainty\\u201d or \\u201cdifficulties in planning\\u201d are showing up in manufacturing surveys. The latest Michigan survey reported a negative balance of opinion on tariffs, and even speeches by foreign central bankers are highlighting risks. Two variants of these concerns, outlined in slide 10, seem particularly resonant of late\\u2014first, that the situation could escalate dramatically into a trade war, and, second, that heightened uncertainty about policy outcomes could weigh on confidence and investment, even absent an escalation. In order to provide some framework to these possibilities, we use an open economy model developed by the IF staff to analyze trade policy. In the first case, we assume over a period of time\\u2014in this case, a year and a half\\u2014that people become increasingly convinced that the United States and the rest of the world will enter a trade war, and that, at the end of that period, their fears are realized: Both countries set 10 percent tariffs on all imports lasting five years. In the second case, people perpetually anticipate a trade war, but the event never materializes. Although stylized, these scenarios help illustrate the potential effect on the U.S. economy, shown on your last slide. In a trade war, illustrated by the green lines, the implementation of tariffs leads to a jump in prices for imported goods both here and abroad, reduced demand for exports, and some shift in production toward import- May 1\\u20132, 2018 33 of 185 competing industries. Inflation spikes and output growth slows markedly, as firms reduce investment in response to the higher costs of imported inputs and flagging profits. Higher import prices also weigh on the real incomes of consumers. Even in the case in which a trade war never happens, the blue lines, if firms and consumers anticipate a trade war and understand its costs, they will reduce investment today as they revise down their expectations about future output and profits. This \\u201cfear factor\\u201d will put a damper on growth as long as the uncertainty lasts. Furthermore, considerably worse outcomes could well materialize, including if the threat or existence of a trade war diminishes total factor productivity growth through reduced technology transfer and research and development, triggers a significant global market correction, or causes serious financial stresses in foreign economies heavily reliant on trade. If this recitation has driven your spring spirits into a Maypole, I would like to remind you that these are risks, and our baseline is significantly cheerier. I turn it over to Josh and the uplift that only an assessment of U.S. financial stability can provide. 4 Thanks, Beth Anne. I\\u2019ll be referring to the handout titled \\u201cMaterial for Briefing on Financial Stability Developments.\\u201d Our assessment is that the overall vulnerabilities across the U.S. financial system remain moderate\\u2014a situation in which shocks to the economy are neither unusually amplified nor unusually attenuated by the financial system. As summarized in the first panel, we think that, overall, valuations are elevated relative to fundamentals, an assessment we have had for about a year. Valuations in equity and corporate bond markets have come down a little amid bouts of elevated volatility but are still high by historical standards. Valuations of leveraged loans and commercial real estate increased further from already stretched conditions. And, by our usual metrics, residential real estate appears to be only somewhat overvalued. As you know, valuations for risky assets have been supported by low risk-free rates, which themselves are low because markets expect a moderate pace of monetary policy tightening, and, as can be seen to the right, the nominal Treasury term premium is quite low. You\\u2019ve heard us say before that a jump in risk-free rates\\u2014due to a change in policy rate expectations or in the term premium\\u2014would cause a broad revaluation of asset prices or a further stretching of valuations. I\\u2019m going to linger a bit on the next two panels to describe one way that could happen. The middle-left panel shows the correlation of stock prices and Treasury yields. As can be seen in the unshaded portion of that chart, stock prices and Treasury yields were negatively correlated in the 1980s and most of the 1990s. In contrast, since the late 1990s\\u2014around the time of the Asian financial crisis, the Russian financial crisis, 4 The materials used by Mr. Gallin are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). May 1\\u20132, 2018 34 of 185 and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management\\u2014stock prices have tended to be positively correlated with Treasury yields. That positive correlation has meant that prices for Treasuries and stocks have moved in opposite directions, making Treasuries a useful hedge for stocks. Investors in Treasuries \\u201cpay\\u201d a premium for this hedge by accepting lower yields. This downward pressure on yields will abate or disappear if the yield\\u2013stock price correlation becomes negative again in a sustained way. Although we can\\u2019t pin down precisely why the correlation changed sign, we can speculate about what could make it change back. In one plausible story\\u2014 summarized to the right\\u2014the negative correlation before the late 1990s was driven by expectations that investors formed amid supply shocks, stagflation, and a changing monetary policy regime. A positive inflation surprise back then was generally considered bad news, driving Treasury yields up and stock prices down. Since the late 1990s, investors have been forming expectations, under a well-understood monetary policy regime and in an environment dominated more by demand shocks. The experience has been one of disinflationary recessions and financial crises in which positive inflation surprises have generally been considered good news that pushes both yields and stock prices up. Could this pattern reverse? We\\u2019ve caught glimpses recently of inflation-as-badnews again at center stage. For example, stocks fell sharply and Treasury yields rose the day of the employment report in February. Flight-to-safety flows pushed inflation fears back into the wings again soon after, but a more persistent return of that inflation dynamic would reduce the negative insurance premium on Treasuries and drive yields up, with potentially large effects on a broad range of risky asset prices. Let\\u2019s pivot from valuations to leverage. We judge vulnerabilities associated with financial-sector leverage to be low, as banks and insurance companies, not shown, remain well capitalized. However, as you can see in the lower-left panel, leverage at hedge funds has been rising recently. That panel shows a relatively timely, but relatively narrow, measure of leverage\\u2014that provided by prime brokers for equity investing. Gross leverage is in black and net leverage is in red, and both have moved up notably in recent months through January. Those data are a bit stale and exclude leverage for other asset classes and leverage achieved using derivatives. Unfortunately, our most comprehensive data on hedge fund leverage is so stale\\u2014it\\u2019s from June\\u2014that I\\u2019m not showing it. But answers to the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which is shown to the right, give us a peek at recent changes in leverage. The neutral readings for Q4 and Q1 suggest that leverage at hedge funds has flattened out recently after more than a year of increases. We aren\\u2019t yelling \\u201cfire\\u201d yet on hedge fund leverage, and certainly not for the financial sector as a whole, but it\\u2019s something to keep our eyes on. If you flip to the next page, you can see in the first panel that real debt balances for households have continued to rise only for prime borrowers (shown in black). Balances have stayed remarkably flat for the near prime and subprime groups (in blue May 1\\u20132, 2018 35 of 185 and red, respectively). And although the relatively restrictive supply of credit to nonprime borrowers has boosted the financial resilience of the household sector, delinquency rates for some forms of consumer credit have moved up recently, suggesting rising strains among riskier borrowers. Overall, we view vulnerabilities arising from household leverage as being in the low-to-moderate range. In contrast, as we have since mid-2015, we judge vulnerabilities due to leverage in the nonfinancial business sector to be elevated. As you can see in the panel to the right, net issuance of risky debt peaked at a very high level in 2014 and had decelerated through the middle of last year, but it picked back up again in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the strength of leveraged loan issuance. I\\u2019ll note here that the GAO\\u2019s determination that the \\u201cInteragency Guidance on Leveraged Lending\\u201d was a rule does not appear, as yet, to have affected lending. Leverage at speculative-grade and unrated firms\\u2014the middle-left panel\\u2014remains above historical norms. Should issuance of risky debt return to the elevated pace seen a few years back, vulnerabilities in this sector would intensify. Indeed, as summarized in the middle-right panel, the April QS briefing included a stress test of nonfinancial businesses along those lines. The scenario\\u2014which is one among several\\u2014assumes that for the next three years, debt expands 10 percent per year, about what we saw from 2012 to 2015. Then the economy is hit with the CCAR Severely Adverse Scenario, and then we focused on the more adverse tail of potential outcomes. Our model\\u2019s projection has defaults on high-yield bonds reaching about 20 percent by the end of 2022 and defaults on leveraged loans reaching 6 percent, about their respective levels during the Great Recession. Mark-to-market loss rates would also be significant\\u201418 percent for high-yield bonds and 13 percent for leveraged loans. As summarized in the lower-left panel, we continue to judge vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation to be low. Systemically important firms have significant holdings of high-quality liquid assets, maturity transformation at Federal Home Loan Banks has edged down, and there hasn\\u2019t been significant growth in money fund alternatives or in outstanding levels of \\u201crunnable\\u201d securities. However, we cannot see all shadow banking activities, and, more broadly, we do remain somewhat concerned about market liquidity amid elevated volatility. Your last panel provides a market-based assessment of firms\\u2019 fragility and systemic risk by plotting CDS spreads (a measure of fragility) on the x-axis and CoVaRs (a measure of systemic risk) on the y-axis. Deutsche Bank, shown in orange, has the highest CDS spread of the group. However, Deutsche Bank also has a relatively low CoVaR, suggesting that its distress poses less systemic risk than would distress at the large global firms, shown in red. Of course, a low CoVaR relative to one of those red banks does not mean Deutsche Bank, or any of the firms in black for that matter, is not systemically important. Market-based measures of risk, and the models we use to interpret them, are imperfect. Markets may excel at aggregating information and sentiment, but investors\\u2014and central bank staff members\\u2014have been known to be too sanguine. May 1\\u20132, 2018 36 of 185 Our summary heat map is on exhibit 3 for your reference. Those are my prepared remarks, and Bill, Beth Anne, and I would be happy to try to address your questions. Thanks very much. Let\\u2019s now turn to a Q&A on these briefings, and then, after that is completed, we\\u2019ll have an opportunity to comment on financial stability issues. So any questions on those great briefings? Vice Chairman. I had a question for Beth Anne and a question for Joshua. Beth Anne, we\\u2019re talking about tariffs. What happens if we get quotas instead? I noticed that with South Korea, we end up in a quota world rather than a tariff world, and you can imagine that that could be where the negotiation leads us. How do you think about quotas? You get less government revenues. Yes, exactly. In some ways, it\\u2019s actually a worse world. Worse. I imagine that, to the extent that the quotas result in price increases, then you\\u2019d see the effects flow through as probably somewhat worse effects on consumption or government balances. It seems to me like that\\u2019s a possible outcome. Countries agree to quotas because they get the rents rather than we get the rents. Right. Thinking about it in terms of a trade war would mean just an almost voluntary reduction, which is hard to imagine, but the effects would be negative, and I think you could think of them in that way. Thank you. As long as it goes through prices. Josh, I had a question. I\\u2019ve noticed that the triple-B tranche of debt securities has been growing really rapidly relative to the other investment grades. Are we thinking at all about the risk of next recession? A lot of those triple-Bs become high May 1\\u20132, 2018 37 of 185 yield, The triple-B market now is much bigger than the high-yield market, and those cliff effects could actually lead to quite a bit of pressure on firms, because a lot of people can\\u2019t invest in high yields. Their mandate doesn\\u2019t support it. Is that a risk that the staff worries about? Yes. That\\u2019s something that we have looked at. We\\u2019ve looked at the distribution of credit ratings of various bonds, and I\\u2019ve seen reports in the news along those lines. It\\u2019s like a wall at triple-B, and is the water sort of piling up against it. It does look like there is some movement in that direction, certainly if you look at the bigger categories. Some of the people in the division\\u2014not me\\u2014looked at the more granular data, and, within that piling up, it doesn\\u2019t actually look like we\\u2019re really piling up right against that wall as much as it might seem if you look at those chunkier data. However, it is something that we\\u2019re keeping an eye on. Thank you. Thanks. President Kashkari. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bill, a question on the staff\\u2019s outlook and forecast. You mentioned, and it\\u2019s been in the Tealbook for a while, that the staff thinks that we\\u2019re running above potential in terms of the labor market relative to trends. But in Tealbook A, we also look at manufacturing utilization. It\\u2019s still low relative to the past 30 or 40 years. I\\u2019m just curious\\u2014you\\u2019re the guy sitting there, so I\\u2019m sorry to pick on you, representing Tealbook A\\u2014how do you reconcile those two? Because I would have thought that if firms were really scarce workers, they\\u2019d be using all of the capital they possibly could, because they\\u2019d have no choice. And yet we see a gap in manufacturing utilization\\u2014or capital utilization. Is there a way to reconcile those two? One way is to think about the different sectors of the economy. I think one reason is that manufacturing has had some adverse demand shocks associated with the May 1\\u20132, 2018 38 of 185 strengthening of the dollar, in particular, and that\\u2019s one reason that the growth in manufacturing has lagged the growth in the overall economy. More generally, I think manufacturing has been on a long-run structural decline, and sometimes it takes a while for the capacity to be scrapped. So there probably is an excess capacity there that\\u2019s not being used. But it\\u2019s being offset, in our view, in terms of the overall economy, by tightness elsewhere in the labor market and in the economy. But\\u2014correct me if I\\u2019m wrong\\u2014I thought the perspective was, manufacturing employment declines because of big productivity gains, but that we\\u2019re still manufacturing goods whether domestically or around the world. I think, overall, that was certainly true for a long time, but maybe over the past decade or so the share of manufacturing output in overall output has declined as well. I think Norm Morin is in the back and may have something to add. It\\u2019s absolutely the case that the share of manufacturing employment has been trending down for decades and decades, and it\\u2019s also the case that the manufacturing share of value-added has also been coming down. But I think Bill hit on the main point that one reason for a gap between capacity utilization and other measures of slack is that in the 2000s, with the China shock and so on, demand for manufacturing output has grown reasonably slowly, and in a number of industries capacity hasn\\u2019t been shed as quickly as demand has declined. So you have a large number of industries in which capacity utilization is very low among other industries where capacity utilization is at more-normal levels. In addition, there are a variety of hypotheses accounting for a secular decline in average capacity utilization across industries.. For example, with capital becoming cheaper relative to May 1\\u20132, 2018 39 of 185 warehouse space, there are changes to tradeoffs, and these changes work in favor of keeping additional buffer capacity over keeping higher inventories. Thanks. Thank you. Governor Brainard. Yes. I just wanted to ask about the analysis of term premiums and ask what your view is as to whether this period of very low term premiums seems likely to be consistent with a period when inflation is bouncing around 2 percent and we seem to be in the vicinity of full employment. Does that have any implications for your view about these correlations or for the sustainability of a zero term premium? Yes. The way I and people who do the research in this area have been thinking about this is, it just depends on steering between a liquidity trap or zero lower bound problems on one side and high inflation or stagflation on the other side. And if we\\u2019re getting to full employment with inflation bouncing around the target of 2 percent, we\\u2019re moving away from that liquidity trap area, and so you would expect the correlations to not be as positive as we saw when we were really worried about falling into that Scylla and Charybdis or something. I can\\u2019t remember which one\\u2019s the whirlpool, but that\\u2019s the liquidity trap. And so I would expect that term premiums on Treasuries would move up, and that\\u2019s actually consistent with the staff forecast. Thanks. President Rosengren. Question for Josh on the Deutsche Bank dot in your chart 2\\u20136. How much comfort should I take from the CoVar if I think about financial instability in Europe as opposed to the United States? The set of institutions here are U.S. institutions. However, as the banking system in Europe never got as capitalized as we did and in view of the problems in May 1\\u20132, 2018 40 of 185 Italy that were highlighted in the international presentation, if you were to do a CoVar that was focused on European financial stability, do you have a different view of that dot, particularly in light of how far out it is on the CDS spread? Yes. Let me just start by making the broader point that CoVar is one measure that we look at. I think it is useful for looking at the cross-sectional patterns across these firms. But it is just one measure, and it\\u2019s imperfect, like any other measure. And Deutsche Bank is a large, systemically important institution. So I\\u2019ll get to your question for a second. I wouldn\\u2019t even necessarily look at that low CoVar and say we don\\u2019t have to worry about Deutsche Bank for the United States. Of course, then, if we\\u2019re moving toward your question, what about globally or in Europe\\u2014I don\\u2019t know what the CoVar would look like for Deutsche Bank if you did it against the European financial system. Presumably, it would be higher. I think it would be more concerning. Just to finish it off, one of the reasons why CoVar is relatively low for the United States\\u2014it\\u2019s not because Deutsche Bank is in good shape. It\\u2019s actually because Deutsche Bank\\u2019s asset price movements relative to the U.S. financial markets\\u2014 asset prices\\u2014aren\\u2019t as big. So that translation of that distress, presumably, would be bigger in Europe. I would add only one thing to that, President Rosengren, which is that we do have a staff process going on to look at some of the broader systemic consequences should something bad happen at the firm, and one of the key channels is the transmission of stress to other European firms. One could imagine it happening either for direct reasons or because they have similar business models or exposures. And there\\u2019s a general sense that what happens to one child could happen to its sibling as well. So I\\u2019d say that\\u2019s an area of active work at the moment. May 1\\u20132, 2018 41 of 185 And I would highlight the point that if something were to happen in Deutsche Bank, it would be a very big test for the nascent European institutions that are designed to deal with these bank restructurings, and so it could have implications for that as well. Thank you. President Bullard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\u2019m looking at \\u201cMaterial for Briefing on the International Outlook,\\u201d page 5, the \\u201cAFE Policy Rates\\u201d picture. This is, I guess, a Taylor (1999) rule for the Fed. If we instead followed the market-based path, which is on the next page, what should I think about that? Would that mean that the dollar would not strengthen, that foreign economies would grow maybe more slowly, and foreign inflation would glow more slowly? Was that the idea? Your question is, we have a big policy surprise if the United States unfolded as the market anticipates\\u2014what would that imply for the dollar? Right. In our forecast, that would imply a weaker dollar than we have projected, although it would have to be considerably weaker not to have any surprise at all. Well, the next page shows the Committee going to 2\\u00bd percent or something like that. So if we followed that path, then there\\u2019d be no change in the dollar, I guess. Is that right? Because there\\u2019d be no surprise compared with what the markets are expecting. If you can answer this, you\\u2019ll be the only one on the planet who could. [Laughter] In the forecast, what would it be? May 1\\u20132, 2018 42 of 185 Considering the design of our model, I would hesitate to say we would see no surprise in the dollar, because we\\u2019ve seen a surprise in the dollar between now and when we closed the Tealbook. Absolutely. But the way that our model is structured, it is based on policy surprises both in the United States and abroad. You would need to have no policy surprises in either area. Okay. And, just also looking at this picture, what does the model say about the world neutral real policy rate? Because this says that we\\u2019re going to be some 425 basis points above Europe at the end of the forecast horizon. Is there a global real interest rate that\\u2019s halfway in between, or is it one for the United States and one for Europe, or what? This is a long-standing question. We look at what we consider a neutral rate for individual countries, and the neutral real rate tends to be range either from 1 to \\u00bd percent, depending on the country, which would put the nominal rate at between, say, 2\\u00bd percent and 3 percent. Oh, I see. Even for the United States there\\u2019s such a range of what you think is the neutral rate that we think that it would be difficult to come up with a very cogent point estimate of the world neutral rate. One issue I\\u2019d like to mention here is that we\\u2019re looking right now at about half the world. And if you think that productivity growth, real interest rates, and output growth in other parts of the world contribute to a world real interest rate, then you would see somewhat higher. May 1\\u20132, 2018 43 of 185 Okay. I see. So, according to the model, the FOMC has to be very tight in order to control above-trend real GDP growth, which otherwise would lead to inflation. Thank you. Thank you. If there are no further questions, then let\\u2019s begin the opportunity for comments on financial stability issues, beginning with Governor Quarles. Thank you, Chairman. We haven\\u2019t had a go-round on financial stability since January. And at that time, that reminded us of an old Western, The Lucky Texan, starring John Wayne, who looked out and said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s quiet out there. Too quiet.\\u201d [Laughter] Now, I have to admit, I stole that line from Andreas Lehnert. We were exchanging our favorite movie lines. My favorite movie line, unfortunately, is from Trading Places, in which Dan Aykroyd keeps protesting, \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t heroin. It was PCP.\\u201d [Laughter] But I couldn\\u2019t figure out any way to get that into the framework. [Laughter] But, at that moment, the very low levels of volatility, obviously, were remarkable. And then, just as in The Lucky Texan, no sooner were the words uttered then came the ambush from the Clanton Gang. So investors that were betting on declines in volatility took significant losses. Attention was focused on the exchange-traded products that lost effectively all of their value in a single day. And then the mechanical rebalancing of those products amplified the rise in volatility. But, at the end of the day, only about $5 billion was invested in those products. So the second-round effects coming from all of that were relatively muted. And, at the end of the day, I suppose it\\u2019s not surprising that those second-round effects have not gone terribly far, because, at the end of the day, we haven\\u2019t had much net revaluation. Asset valuations are still relatively high. May 1\\u20132, 2018 44 of 185 So what did all of that noise do to investor appetite for risk? We can go back and look at the surveys that Bob Shiller has been sending out to investors since 1987, and all of that\\u2019s routinely summarized in what the Yale SOM puts out\\u2014its stock market confidence indexes. Among institutional investors, the percent reporting that they think the stock market is going to be higher in a year\\u2019s time, which was 80 percent a year ago, is now at 63 percent. But that has been a steady decline. There wasn\\u2019t really much change after the market volatility in February, suggesting that it didn\\u2019t really fundamentally change the institutional investor\\u2019s outlook. For retail investors, the story is a little different. Their confidence peaked at about 71 percent in January, and it has now fallen very dramatically to 62 percent, essentially as a result of the volatility. That sounds about right to me. Professional money managers were quietly ebullient a year ago, and they\\u2019ve been growing more cautious. Households, who appear to have been the ones who are primarily buying these volatility-linked ETFs, reacted a bit more. More broadly, we\\u2019ve been seeing a trend towards increased caution. Banks began tightening standards on CRE loans back in 2016. IPO volume is solidly in the middle of the range. The deep junk share of newly issued high-yield corporate bonds has been falling. So, on balance, investors continue to have an elevated appetite for risky products, but none of the preceding facts suggests the signs of a self-fulfilling, speculative cycle where assets are being purchased on the expectation that you can sell them to a greater fool next year. When investors have a strong appetite for risk, the financial system usually finds a way to satisfy it. So what are we seeing when it comes to borrowing? First, the relatively straightforward case of the household sector: Some signs of excessive borrowing\\u2014default rates on subprime auto and credit card loans have been rising a little bit, and student loan debt outstanding has continued to grow. But, overall, the picture doesn\\u2019t suggest building financial May 1\\u20132, 2018 45 of 185 imbalances in the household sector. Only recently did debt growth in the household sector actually match income growth, finally. In addition, effectively all of the debt that\\u2019s being added in the household sector is among borrowers who have very strong credit histories. Of greater concern is the business sector, I think. In this recovery\\u2014as everyone here knows, there initially was a rapid increase in business borrowing that tailed off around 2015, but it left the sector quite leveraged. The ratio of corporate debt to GDP is at the upper end of its historical range. It\\u2019s near levels that were reached in 2008, in the late 1990s, and in the late 1980s. The ratio of debt to assets is at a 20-year high. This leverage has been particularly true among speculative-grade, unrated firms. And, with investor risk appetite still high, conditions are in place that would permit a rapid reacceleration in debt growth among those firms. That said, the limited data we have over the past few months doesn\\u2019t show a massive increase in lending in this sector. It\\u2019s something to monitor in coming months. But this level of indebtedness is something that has existed for a while. So what are the consequences of that business sector leverage? Even if you haven\\u2019t had an acceleration of it recently, obviously, despite the historically high debt-to-income ratio, interest expense burdens are actually quite low, because rates have been so low. So if rates were to rise suddenly, loans would reprice upwards. Some of the staff work that has been done suggests that that shock wouldn\\u2019t result in a particularly high level of interest expenses because interest rates are currently so low and because a substantial portion of the debt is fixed rate, mostly in the form of bonds. If rates did rise against the backdrop of, particularly, an improving economy, I don\\u2019t think we should expect to see a material amount of distress there. Of greater concern would be how would businesses react to a drop in their actual or projected revenues with such high debt May 1\\u20132, 2018 46 of 185 loads, right? Obviously, it\\u2019s not unreasonable that they would pull back on investment or on their hiring plans more than would otherwise be the case. We might be surprised by the strength of that movement. And, certainly, it\\u2019s likely that credit losses should be set to rise. High-yield bond default rates were unusually low at last year-end. So, if nothing else, just going back to the mean would mean that they ought to rise from where they are. It\\u2019s plausible that credit losses on loans to businesses would be higher than expected in a future downturn. And if the resulting surge in defaults was to some extent unanticipated, you would expect risk premiums on bonds and loans to widen as well, resulting in larger mark-tomarket losses. So the natural question, then, finally, is the extent to which financial institutions are exposed to outsized losses on loans to businesses. If those losses were to threaten their solvency, they might withdraw more than they otherwise would from the sector, resulting in a liquidity crunch, and cause an even more severe downtown. In that connection, banks appear well positioned to handle losses that would occur in a major business downturn. This year\\u2019s stress test, for example\\u2014which both Governor Brainard and I talked about in our previous discussion of financial stability\\u2014effectively contemplates such an outcome. Stock prices, equity volatility, and corporate bond yields in the stress test hit levels that were last seen in 2009. Participating banks should be sufficiently capitalized against stress emanating from the business sector, so they won\\u2019t be forced to curtail lending or pull back on other activities such as market making. I should also mention what I see as the financial stability consequences of the recent actions on bank capital that the Board took: our stress capital buffer proposal and the proposed recalibration of the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio applicable to the largest banks. Some of you may have noticed that, with the leverage ratio action in particular, we managed to bring May 1\\u20132, 2018 47 of 185 off the singular feat of uniting the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Elizabeth Warren into pulsing harmony. Was she the singing coloratura above, like the Queen of the Night from The Magic Flute? I view these actions, however, as having important long-term benefits and as being cyclically neutral. So the stress capital buffer would combine our stress capital regime and our point-in-time capital regime in a way that results in a material simplification and, thus, a reduction in the administrative burden of the whole system of capital regulation without any material reduction in the level of capital. Some of our largest banks would actually have slightly higher capital levels. Some banks a tier below that would have slightly lower levels. Nevertheless, the change would be capital-neutral to the system as a whole. The proposed change to the supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR, has a different type of benefit. As many of you know, our initial calibration of that capital requirement, which was applicable only to our largest banks, was materially higher than the Basel standard, about twice the level in much of the rest of the world. That had the result of making it the binding capital restraint for some of our largest banks. And a leverage ratio is an important backstop to the inevitable idiosyncrasies and misjudgments in any risk-based regime. But when it ceases being a backstop and becomes the effectively binding ratio, we have created a regulatory incentive for the system to add risk because we\\u2019ve told the regulatory institution your capital cost will be the same whether your asset is risky or safe, so they have an incentive to seek return without regard to risk. The adjustment we proposed brought the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, or eSLR, which is our third leverage ratio, into alignment with the Basel standard, returned it to being an effective backstop, and did so without a material reduction in capital in the system overall. The staff estimate is that the proposal would allow out of the banking system May 1\\u20132, 2018 48 of 185 $400 million across all of our largest banks, which is 0.04 percent of the roughly $1 trillion in capital that these banks had at the end of September. So it\\u2019s really kind of the platonic ideal of policymaking. We had an important alignment of incentives without any reduction in the overall level of capital in the system. In conclusion, on balance, the events of the past few months may have left the financial system actually slightly stronger. The volatility that greeted the Chairman on his first day on the job appears to have had the salutary effect of breaking a period of unnatural quiet, without an ambush by the Clanton Gang. The business sector remains quite leveraged, and its balance sheet, if it doesn\\u2019t improve before any future downturn, will expose investors to larger losses. However, while the financial system is exposed, it ought to be able to absorb such an outcome. But that would inevitably be difficult, and we should all be watching developments. Thank you. President Rosengren. Thank you, Chair Powell. At our previous financial stability discussion, I raised the issue of whether the countercyclical capital buffer should be set at zero, under current financial conditions. After the meeting, several staff members pointed out, quite correctly, that under the current weighting of risks, zero was appropriate and asked what I thought should be weighed differently. Our current criteria place significant weight on the current amount of capital in banks, with little weight on how well positioned fiscal and monetary policies are to react to a negative shock. The last crisis was mitigated by substantial fiscal measures that significantly raised the debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, because equilibrium real interest rates were higher, the Fed had more flexibility to lower rates than we have now. With reduced fiscal and monetary buffers May 1\\u20132, 2018 49 of 185 currently available, a greater weight for economic stabilization should be borne by regulatory buffers. One of the principles set out by the FPC in the United Kingdom is that in a standard risk environment, a countercyclical capital buffer of 1 percent is consistent with the FPC moving the buffer up before risks become elevated. Following a standard closer to that used in the United Kingdom has the benefit of making it easier to lower the capital buffer as needed to help offset the effects of an adverse shock, consistent with good macroprudential policy, while still making sure that microprudential solvency standards are also met. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Kaplan. Thank you, Chairman Powell. I just want to comment on one narrow question, which has come up\\u2014and it came up in our previous meeting\\u2014about whether there is still a significant risk of a February-type, quant-driven selloff happening in the markets. My own view of the most likely case is that the probability of this has actually been reduced, and I\\u2019ll just go through a few reasons why. Then I\\u2019ll go through the opposing view. Obviously, as we talked in January, what happened in February came as a result of 15 months of historically low leverage. And, unfortunately, a lot of these vol-targeting funds and other forms of risk parity had been built up. As we sit here now, volatility is now persistently higher, and I think much more in line with what we would normally experience. In addition, the short end of the curve is now a viable investment option. It is even more so than it was in January because rates have moved up. Some of that is because of anticipation of the Fed. I think some of it is because of anticipation of a large amount of short-end supply from the federal government. But, for whatever reason, I think more investors feel they don\\u2019t have to take risks. They can actually park some money in the two-year and the three-year or even in bills. May 1\\u20132, 2018 50 of 185 Some excess has been wrung out of the system. I think market participants today have a greater appreciation of risk. Andon the basis of what I hear from those in the market who use models and look at vol-targeting funds based on data they can glean, it looks like vol-targeting funds and variations of it are less invested than they were in January, and they have somewhat less leverage on than they did in January. And, because of that, they believe the potential for selling is in fact quantitatively less than it was in January and early February. So that\\u2019s the good news, and we may look back and say February, therefore, was a blessing; everything that happened was healthy, and it makes it less likely to happen. There is an opposing view held by some people whose opinions I respect in the market who still believe that February instead was coming attractions, that while VIX products\\u2014as Governor Quarles said\\u2014were washed out, risk parity, vol-targeting shortfall, and other embedded leverage in the financial system are still alive and well out there. And they point out that a deeper selloff in February\\u2014if there had been another leg down and a little bit higher or persistent spike in vol\\u2014would have led to a lot more selling than what we saw. They warn that this bigger wave could be coming in the future, and they remind everyone that vol targeting and other derivations of it\\u2014risk parity\\u2014are linear on the upside and exponential in terms of selling on the downside, much like a put would be or we experienced with CDS in 2008 and 2009. Whatever the arguments are, I do think we\\u2019re probably in better shape. The one thing I do have conviction about is we don\\u2019t know exactly what we don\\u2019t know. And the smarter the people I talk to, the more I realize what we don\\u2019t know. We don\\u2019t know what we don\\u2019t know. The data on the nonbank financial system\\u2014the shadow system\\u2014aren\\u2019t great. There is no stress testing in the shadow system. We know we can see debt, but derivatives positions are often netted, and, unless there is a stress scenario, you can\\u2019t see how much is out there. May 1\\u20132, 2018 51 of 185 So the only comment on all of this that I would make is we would be wise not to rely just on data. We should continue to be vigilant, and I think\\u2014as I said in the January meeting\\u2014 phone calls and system checks have never been more important. Going around and making calls to participants in the market, to hedge funds, and to other people we respect will be continually important from here on, just to get a sense of what\\u2019s going on, because, honestly, the smartest people that I talk to in the market think we\\u2019re in better shape, but they\\u2019re not sure. We\\u2019d be wise to be vigilant and run a little scared on this and keep making checks in the months and even years ahead. Thank you. Thank you. President George. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to thank the staff, because I find their diligence in focusing our attention on some of these vulnerabilities is useful. I have just a couple of observations. I agree with the staff that while a number of the factors look like they\\u2019re going to support a continued expansion, but\\u2014I think, looking at some of the underlying credit dynamics could be pointing us to growing pressures about a turn in the credit cycle. One of the things I see as evidence of this on a small scale in my own region is the rise in liquidity risk in community banks. Clearly, this is unlikely to be a systemic risk issue for the broader economy, but it does point to conditions that look similar to past credit cycles. By that, I look at the robust loan growth going on right now: The average community bank loan portfolio has been increasing more than 8 percent a year over the past three years. But deposit growth is not keeping pace, which means that these banks have a growing reliance on things like listing service deposits, broker deposits, or Home Loan Bank advances. Of particular concern is that an increasing number of these institutions with elevated liquidity risk profiles also have asset concentrations in higher risk loan categories like commercial real estate and ag loans. This May 1\\u20132, 2018 52 of 185 vulnerability has the potential to magnify stress in a downturn, especially in our smaller rural communities. In terms of issues that affect the broader financial system, several of these points have been noted. The long, steady economic expansion has increased investor appetite for risk. The extended period of low interest rates has encouraged investors to reach for yield. And this combination has generated strong investor demand for commercial real estate investments, highyield bonds, and leveraged loans. Strong investor demand stimulated credit flows to risky borrowers, which has been facilitated by weaker underwriting standards. These credit flows have pushed values of CRE, leveraged loans, and high-yield bonds to very high levels and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector. The staff memo on assessing vulnerabilities in nonfinancial corporate credit finds losses in the moderate-to-notable range, depending on the stress scenario, yet those simulations are not likely to account fully for possible reactions of other market actors. If initial losses lead to market uncertainty, increased risk aversion, and a general retreat by market participants, the losses experienced by banks, nonbank lenders, and investors could be substantially higher. Given that, I think we should be particularly mindful of these vulnerabilities as bank regulators entertain a recalibration and relaxation of capital requirements for the largest banks. Allowing G-SIBs to increase their leverage in the face of these risks warrants caution, knowing that history reminds us that the value of building countercyclical buffers now will not be apparent until the next downturn. Thank you. Thank you. Governor Brainard. Thank you. As we just heard, our scan of financial vulnerabilities suggests risks are elevated in two areas, and there is a particular overlap in the corporate sector. May 1\\u20132, 2018 53 of 185 First, even after taking into account recent market volatility, asset valuations across a range of markets remain elevated relative to a variety of historical norms. If\\u2014as we just discussed\\u2014the currently prevailing Treasury security term premiums, which are very low relative to historical values, were to experience a snapback, the effect on asset valuations would likely be very far reaching. Second, corporate bond yields remain very low. Spreads on junk bonds and on leveraged loans, particularly, are near the low end of their historical range, and prices of multifamily residential and industrial CRE have risen, while capitalization rates are at historical lows. Related to this, the debt-to-income ratio of the nonfinancial business sector is now at the upper end of its hist.orical distribution, and net leverage at speculative-grade firms is especially elevated. As we\\u2019ve seen in previous cycles, unexpected negative shocks to earnings, in combination with increased interest rates, could quickly lead to rising levels of delinquencies among these borrowers and related stresses to some bank\\u2019s balance sheets. The staff\\u2019s stress test of corporate balance sheets highlights some of these possible vulnerabilities in transmission channels. Despite these risks, overall vulnerabilities are assessed to be moderate, and that assessment rests, in great measure, on our regulatory and supervisory framework that was put in place post-crisis. In particular, the capital and liquidity buffers that our financial institutions have built are key bulwarks in the resilience of our system. Not only do our largest firms now have the right kind and amount of liquidity calibrated to their funding needs and their likely run risk, but they are also required to know where it is and to ensure it\\u2019s positioned or readily accessible where it\\u2019s most likely to be needed at moments of stress, which was not the case pre-crisis. May 1\\u20132, 2018 54 of 185 In parallel, the quality of capital has improved, with a focus on the most loss-absorbing type, which is common equity, and the quantum of capital has increased through higher minimum requirements and new capital conservation and G-SIB buffers. And, of course, our annual stress tests increase the ability of these banks to absorb losses and continue to lend during times of stress. My reading is that the improvement in regulatory buffers has contributed to the international competitiveness and strength of the U.S. banking system. Over recent years, bank lending has been healthy, and profits are strong by any measure. Against the backdrop of stretched asset valuations, sizable fiscal stimulus is likely to reinforce cyclical pressures at a time when we\\u2019re at above-trend economic growth and resource utilization is tightening. History suggests that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards and an attendant increase in risky debt levels. If we\\u2019ve learned anything from the past, it\\u2019s that we must be especially vigilant about the health of our financial system in good times, when potential vulnerabilities may be building. We need to be thinking about resilience through the cycle. While there is a natural tendency to question the need for thick capital buffers when times are good, the severe costs associated with not having those buffers to absorb losses become all too evident in a downturn, when it\\u2019s too late to start building them. For that reason, I\\u2019m quite reluctant to see our large banking institutions releasing the capital buffers they\\u2019ve built over the past few years. In fact, if financial vulnerabilities were to broaden, it may become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to safeguard an additional margin of capital as a countercyclical buffer. This would help to sustain their resilience when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follows periods of rapid asset price appreciation and credit growth. And, of course, if the economy were subsequently to weaken, this buffer would be available to release in May 1\\u20132, 2018 55 of 185 order to support lending when it is actually most needed. With regard to monetary policy, countercyclical capital requirements can also be seen as leaning against rising risks at a time when the degree of monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal could be inconsistent with our dual-mandate goals. In addition, unlike monetary policy, countercyclical buffers build resilience. So for all of these reasons, I think this is a topic to which we should return if the economy evolves as we expect. Thank you. Thank you. If there are no further comments on financial stability, why don\\u2019t we have a well-earned coffee break, which will end precisely at 20 minutes after 3:00 p.m. Thank you. [Coffee break] Okay. Let\\u2019s go ahead and start our economic go-round, starting with President Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Incoming data confirm that the economic expansion is very strong. Job growth has been running at an extraordinary pace. Consumer and business confidence is high. Even the fear of a first-quarter pothole in GDP growth didn\\u2019t materialize. And there is good news in nominal wage growth, too. Friday\\u2019s employment cost index release puts the four-quarter change in total compensation at 2.7 percent and on a clear upward trajectory. Looking ahead, several factors will continue to juice the economy, including the double dose of fiscal stimulus, solid global growth, and supportive financial conditions. I expect GDP growth this year and next to average about 2\\u00bd percent, well above potential. As a result, I see the unemployment rate drifting down to 3\\u00bd percent next year. May 1\\u20132, 2018 56 of 185 With all of this good news, I made an extra effort to look for signs belying these days of wine and roses. Sifting through the data, one discordant note is gross domestic income, or GDI, which has been lagging behind GDP growth for some time now. For example, during the second half of last year, annualized growth of GDI fell short of that of real GDP growth by more than 1\\u00bc percentage points. And this discrepancy is particularly noteworthy because of past research by Board staff and others. The GDI may be the more reliable indicator of underlying economic conditions. Specifically, in the past, a shortfall of GDI growth relative to GDP often correctly predicted that the GDP number would be revised down later on. So my staff took another look at the signaling properties of GDI, and they found that since the Great Recession, this predictive advantage of GDI has almost completely disappeared. In the current expansion, GDI has provided little help in forecasting later vintages of GDP. Moreover, in an out-of-sample forecast horserace\\u2014the focus on the recent period\\u2014GDP has been better than GDI at forecasting other measures of activity such as the unemployment rate. I conclude from this analysis that one shouldn\\u2019t take too much signal from the soft GDI data, and that the strength we are seeing across a broad set of indicators is painting an accurate picture. This conclusion is echoed in reports received from my contacts. Throughout the District, businesses are reporting robust growth and ever-tightening labor markets. Indeed, some firms noted that worker shortages have become a binding constraint. Now I know that at our own bank we have numerous openings posted for jobs ranging from IT to police services and the CEO. [Laughter] Along with the high level of job vacancies nationally, we are also seeing the duration of vacancies rise. That is, it\\u2019s taking longer and longer to find suitable workers. This delay is lengthening despite the fact that much more effort and resources are being expended to fill open May 1\\u20132, 2018 57 of 185 positions. Such difficulties in finding workers has led some of my contacts to worry about the sustainability of the current pace of economic growth. The Tealbook alternative simulation on supply constraints illustrates some of the potential implications of this concern. And I should mention that the Board briefing on this topic was very helpful in describing the scenario. Although I view the Okun\\u2019s law deviations implied by the simulation\\u2014that is, very strong output growth with an unchanging unemployment rate\\u2014 as unlikely, this scenario does serve as a useful reminder that a prolonged period of significant overshooting full employment can produce bottlenecks and put unwanted upward pressure on inflation. Staying on the topic of inflation, I\\u2019m reminded of the quote by Winston Churchill, who as a young man described a battlefield by saying, \\u201cNothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.\\u201d We have dodged last year\\u2019s low-inflation bullet. I don\\u2019t know whether I should be breathing a sigh of relief or just counting my blessings that last year\\u2019s downside surprises have indeed proved to be transitory. But what\\u2019s important is that, for all intents and purposes, with the 12-month core inflation rate at 1.9 percent and headline at 2 percent, we are now, in fact, closing in on our 2 percent inflation target. And I expect core inflation to soon reach and then to modestly exceed our target for the next few years, and I view the risks to this forecast as balanced. Finally, to set the stage for my discussion tomorrow of monetary policy, I think it\\u2019s useful to compare our current outlook with the one we had one year ago. According to the median SEPnumbers of March 2017, we were then anticipating that real GDP growth would average about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019. This March, the median SEP numbers showed substantially faster real GDP growth, averaging about 2\\u00bd percent. In keeping with faster May 1\\u20132, 2018 58 of 185 growth, the path of the unemployment rate has come down significantly. Last March, the median SEP put the unemployment rate at 4\\u00bd percent at the end of 2019. In the latest projection, it was 3.6 percent\\u2014a downward revision of nearly a full percentage point, with only a small portion of that explained by a lower estimate of the long-run unemployment rate. The \\u201ctakeaway\\u201d is thatwe now project that the economy in 2018 will run substantially \\u201chotter\\u201d than we did a year ago. In contrast to the inflation outlook for this year, next year is little changed from a year ago. We expect inflation very near our 2 percent goal, a projection now confirmed by the data. Despite substantially faster growth, considerably lower unemployment, and an essentially unchanged future inflation path, the median path for the federal funds rate is almost identical to that of last March. And I will return to this topic of data dependence, or lack thereof, in our policy discussion tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. Governor Quarles. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a fairly optimistic outlook when we last met. Nothing in the past six weeks has much changed that view. Inflation remains toward our target, and unemployment is unchanged near multidecade lows. The economy is in as good a place as it\\u2019s been for a long time. Most people expected a first-quarter dip in real GDP growth. Even that was shallower than the staff or the markets were expecting. Growth is strong, but not so strong that you\\u2019ve got concerns of overheating being ignited. The unemployment rate hasn\\u2019t moved for months. Inflation, while almost to target, hasn\\u2019t shown clear upward momentum. Financial conditions have tightened a little bit since our previous meeting, but not in a way that\\u2019s really particularly surprising. The dollar has strengthened a bit. That\\u2019s less unexpected than its decline over much of the past year. Higher bond yields likely reflect expectations of strong economic growth as May 1\\u20132, 2018 59 of 185 well as the firming of inflation expectations, and they are unlikely to provide much of a drag on economic activity. With the March inflation data, we can finally start putting behind us the one-time drop in the price of mobile telephone services. Core PCE inflation was 1.9 percent in March. It\\u2019s now clear that the weakness of inflation through much of 2017 was, in fact, due to transitory factors. While the upward pressure on prices seems fairly well contained, I obviously acknowledge the risk that in a tight economy, supply constraints could create a kink in the Phillips curve, which is a feature, even if it\\u2019s only a minor component, of the staff forecast, and a possibility explored with greater severity in an alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook. However, I think that a kink like that, while it\\u2019s a possibility, is not a reality. Nominal wage growth has picked up as expected with the tightening of the labor market. The employment cost index increased at the fastest pace in a decade in this past quarter, but this pickup follows a decade of the weakest wage growth on record, and increases in the index remain at a pace that\\u2019s still far below its pre-crisis norm. Another alternative scenario in the Tealbook that I found interesting was the hysteresis scenario that, in some ways, bookends the supply constraint scenario. Obviously, in that scenario, a tight economy elicits additional supply through increased labor force participation and a downward push to the natural rate of unemployment, loosening constraints rather than tightening them. Which world do we live in? I don\\u2019t know. Maybe neither. We should be watching for a sharper increase in price pressures as a signal of binding constraints, but, at the same time, we should acknowledge our uncertainty regarding the natural rate of unemployment as well as the potential capacity of the economy. Again, I thought that the work that we talked about at the last meeting regarding changes in the educational attainment May 1\\u20132, 2018 60 of 185 of the workforce and the potential effect of that on the natural rate of unemployment is quite interesting and potentially quite a material change. So while my estimate is, I think, the same as most others\\u2019 in the SEP, at about 4\\u00bd percent, I have a very big confidence interval around that. And this uncertainty is all the more acute as the changes introduced by the tax bill work their way through the economy. Thank you. Thank you. President Rosengren. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Little has changed in my economic outlook since the previous meeting. The pause I was expecting in the first quarter was less pronounced than I anticipated, and Q1 GDP growth was faster than my estimate of potential growth. Like the Tealbook and most private-sector forecasters, I continue to assume that real GDP for the remainder of this year and all of next year will grow more rapidly than potential GDP, in part because of highly stimulative fiscal policy and only gradual tightening of monetary policy. As a result, I expect labor markets to tighten further, with the unemployment rate falling about \\u00bd percentage point. With inflation likely to be at our 2 percent target but the unemployment rate more than a full percentage point below my estimate of full employment, we will be testing the limits of running a tight labor market economy. Are the low unemployment rates that both the Tealbook and I are expecting sustainable? There has been a great deal of discussion about whether the unemployment rate accurately reflects the true degree of labor market slack\\u2014about whether the low labor force participation rate, which is more than 3 percentage points below its level before the financial crisis, indicates much more labor market slack. As is well known, much of the decline in participation is a consequence of the demographic changes in the workforce. These demographic trends are May 1\\u20132, 2018 61 of 185 significant, and typical estimates suggest that the effective aging would, by itself, lower the aggregate labor force participation rate 80 basis points over the next three years. My staff has looked at how responsive labor force participation rates have been to tightening labor markets historically and during this recovery. Using state-level panel data as well as labor force reentry data across states, they find that prime-age males show little to no cyclical rebound in participation. Older workers tend to postpone their retirement, but the largest response usually comes from young workers. Relying heavily on a cyclical rebound in the participation of the very young might not correspond well to the kind of labor market improvements we would hope for in running a tight labor market economy. Overall, work by my staff indicates that, on account of the significant downward pull on participation and the aging of the workforce, even keeping the aggregate labor force participation rate constant may be a challenge. If we do see more entrants to the labor force, they may well be primarily younger workers entering the workforce prematurely or temporarily. Of course, tight labor markets may also lead to a more restive workforce. Recent examples include strikes and ballot initiatives for better working conditions by nurses in Boston and strikes of public school teachers in many states. Both of these examples indicate that the current tight labor markets lead workers to believe this is an ideal time to demand higher wages and benefits. As for our leading measures of wages and compensation, the rates of increase in the ECI and average hourly earnings are not alarming, but they have risen roughly 75 basis points over the past three years. In this regard, it might be instructive to consider the last time we surpassed full employment in a tightening cycle. We began raising the funds rate from 1 percent in June 2004, when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent and average hourly earnings were increasing May 1\\u20132, 2018 62 of 185 at a 2 percent rate over the preceding 12 months. Two years later, average hourly earnings were growing at a 4 percent clip, a significant increase in wage pressures in a fairly short time. At this point, we were also at the high point of our tightening. Inflation had also risen above 2 percent. It almost goes without saying that the episode did not end well. No two recoveries are the same, but we should not assume that the recent quiescence of wages means they will not, at some point, respond strongly to tight labor markets\\u2014and possibly do so relatively soon. We have little recent experience running the labor market as tight as I expect we will see over the next two years. Prudent risk management would argue for a regular increase in interest rates likely to a level noticeably above our estimates of the equilibrium rate. Such a strategy would gradually guide us back closer to the natural rate, provide some insurance against more pronounced and rapid wage increases that might be expected to accompany such tight labor markets, and increase the probability of a sustained recovery. But as recent volatility highlights, if markets become convinced that labor market pressures are not sustainable and that wages and prices will rise more than we have seen of late, they may anticipate a more vigorous monetary policy response, and financial markets could begin to look a bit more disorderly. At that time, it is likely that reaching-for-yield strategies that were advantageous in the good times will start to look less advantageous, possibly generating losses in unexpected places as markets reverse. Thus, we should not only be concerned with whether labor markets generate wage and price pressures, but also whether such tight labor markets reflect more fundamental macroeconomic imbalances that will eventually become apparent in financial markets and exacerbate the negative effect on the real economy. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Evans. May 1\\u20132, 2018 63 of 185 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The comments received from my directors and other contacts about economic activity continue to be upbeat, and their reports regarding wages and prices point to a further welcome pickup in aggregate inflationary pressures. In general, the manufacturing sector continues to benefit from strong global cap-ex. One of my directors with a global reach noted that while he had seen a first-quarter slowdown in the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region, the slowing was expected to be temporary. He also indicated that uncertainty over international trade policy was generating a lot of talk. However, to date he hadn\\u2019t seen any precautionary pullback in spending. I didn\\u2019t hear much commentary about softness in consumer spending, despite the firstquarter NIPA data. Indeed, my Discover Financial director indicated that the firm\\u2019s numbers continued to be quite strong. Automakers seem comfortable with their sales outlook. Ford\\u2019s forecast of light vehicle sales in 2018 is about 17 million. This is down marginally from last year, but it\\u2019s still at a rate most in the industry see as a healthy, sustainable pace. Labor markets, obviously, are tight. I heard the usual litany of stories regarding shortages of workers as well as a few more reports of large wage increases. These covered both entry-level and higher-skilled manufacturing positions, skilled workers in the construction trades, and truck drivers. In Chicago, local demand is quite strong. My director, who\\u2019s the president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, keeps close track of the building crane count in Chicago. In 2017, it was 61 cranes, an all-time Chicago record, and 2018 is looking quite solid as well. So there will be continued strong demand for skilled construction workers. Still, it\\u2019s not obvious yet that labor markets are overheating. Notably, Manpower, which has a broad line of sight into labor demand, reported only a modest pickup in wage growth and that the increase was less than May 1\\u20132, 2018 64 of 185 they would have expected, given other labor market indicators. This seems in line with the aggregate wage statistics, even with the pickup in the ECI last quarter. I heard numerous reports of higher nonlabor input costs. Tariffs and strong demand have led to a further increase in industrial materials prices. There\\u2019s also been an increase in shipping costs. For some time, we\\u2019ve been hearing that it\\u2019s hard for manufacturers to get trucking companies to ship their products promptly. This round, one of the large equipment manufacturers told me that they finally bit the bullet and started paying a 30 percent premium for shipping\\u2014just as you would expect, right? Now they have the trucking capacity that they need. Another major manufacturer also told me that most companies are now paying up to ensure delivery of critical products. I continue to hear a range of comments regarding the ability of firms to pass through cost increases to their customers. So there still is uncertainty about the strength of businesses\\u2019 pricing power. That said, there were more reports this time of dollar-fordollar pass-through of materials cost as well as some firms realizing even broader price increases. So my sense is that, in the aggregate, we are seeing a modest increase in pricing power. For the national outlook, we haven\\u2019t changed our views about economic growth since our March SEP submission, which had real GDP increasing 3 percent in 2018, 2\\u00bd percent in 2019, and 1\\u00be percent in 2020. And we\\u2019re still projecting that the unemployment rate will drop to near 3\\u00bd percent by late 2018 and stay there through 2020. This is a percentage point below our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. On balance, the incoming data on inflation have been positive. As expected, year-over-year inflation stepped up as the ugly March 2017 data fell out of the calculation, and the anecdotes I just mentioned are consistent with a modest increase in May 1\\u20132, 2018 65 of 185 inflationary pressure. So all in all, I\\u2019m feeling more confident that we are on a trajectory to achieve our symmetric 2 percent objective. This is good news. I\\u2019m still concerned, though, that inflation expectations remain somewhat below levels consistent with our symmetric 2 percent target. Survey measures have not budged off their lows, and the Chicago bank\\u2019s term structure models indicate that, at most, 10 of the roughly 50 basis point increase in nominal Treasury rates since last December represent higher expected inflation. So even though we\\u2019re now just about at 2 percent inflation, I\\u2019m not as confident as I\\u2019d like to be about the sustainability of this accomplishment. I really won\\u2019t be comfortable until inflation expectations are more entrenched symmetrically around 2 percent. While the inflation picture is looking much better, I don\\u2019t think we should declare victory quite yet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Mester. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Overall, there\\u2019s been little change in the economic picture of the Fourth District. Business activity continues to improve at a moderate pace. Firms report ongoing difficulty in attracting and retaining workers. Wage pressures remain elevated. Manufacturers, builders, and freight companies are experiencing substantial input price increases and are finding little resistance in passing on price increases to their customers. The level of the Cleveland Fed staff diffusion index measuring the percentage of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions was 36 in April, essentially unchanged from March. Average readings so far this year are higher than last year and significantly higher than in 2016. Business sentiment remains upbeat. Planned capital expenditures continue on a moderate upward path. Firms continue to cite the tax changes as a spur to investment, although we have not yet seen a strong acceleration. May 1\\u20132, 2018 66 of 185 District labor market conditions have strengthened further since our previous meeting. The District\\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in March, its lowest level since 2001 and more than \\u00bd percentage point below its year-ago level. Year-over-year payroll job growth in the District strengthened in March and has been running at about 1 percent since the middle of last year. This is more than double the Cleveland bank staff\\u2019s 0.4 percent estimate of trend job growth in the District. Hiring remains a challenge for District firms. They\\u2019re meeting the challenge in a variety of ways, with varied results. One steel company has added a second shift and is increasing overtime. A freight firm unable to find qualified drivers or diesel mechanics has idled eight trucks despite strong demand. Another freight firm has started its own apprentice program. A staffing firm reported a notable increase in orders in recent months but trouble finding workers to fill the vacancies. In the midst of this strong demand for labor, wage pressures in the District continue to be elevated. The Cleveland staff\\u2019s wage diffusion index remains at high levels, and wages are rising in all sectors except the retail sector, in which wages have been steady. Nonlabor input cost pressures remain elevated. Prices of construction materials have risen partly because of the steel, aluminum, and lumber tariffs. Manufacturing contacts in the District reported steel price increases of 25 percent or more. A rising share of firms reports having more success in passing on price increases to their customers. Regarding the national economy, while consumption spending moderated in the first quarter, overall real GDP growth was somewhat higher than the consensus forecast, and early indicators point to a pickup in growth in the second quarter. There\\u2019s been little change in my outlook since our previous meeting. I expect above-trend growth, tight labor markets, and May 1\\u20132, 2018 67 of 185 inflation moving back to our 2 percent target over the medium run. The underlying fundamentals of the economy remain favorable, including accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal income, and a global economy that\\u2019s improving overall. The rise in oil prices and increase in the value of the dollar are worth watching, but so far the magnitudes don\\u2019t suggest they pose much of a downside risk. The tax package and increased federal spending are expected to add to an already healthy level of spending for the second half of the year and next year, though the magnitudes and exact timing are somewhat uncertain. While the tax package contains several provisions that affect the tax treatment of home ownership, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace. Financial market volatility has risen from the very low levels of recent years, but investors seem to be taking it in stride, and firms tell us the volatility has not thwarted their spending plans. There\\u2019s continued uncertainty surrounding trade, and geopolitical concerns have risen. The cloud created by the trade situation may not pass over quickly\\u2014being an \\u201cunforced error\\u201d in the midst of a healthy economy. The rhetoric suggests an escalation in the probability of reciprocal tariffs on goods traded between the United States and China. Were such tariffs imposed broadly, this would create a meaningful change in the outlook. Assessing the effect on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on the actions actually taken by the United States and its trading partners with respect to trade. But even without broad tariffs, continuing uncertainty could cause businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the U.S. economy and alter their spending in the near term. So we need to continue to monitor the situation. May 1\\u20132, 2018 68 of 185 Aside from this downside risk, the underlying strength in the economy is illustrated by the very strong conditions in the labor market, which I expect to continue. The unemployment rate at 4.1 percent is below its lowest point during the previous expansion. I expect it to fall further this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. Over the first three months of the year, average monthly payroll job growth has strengthened to about 200,000 jobs, which is well above most economists\\u2019 estimates of trend job growth. Wages and broader labor compensation have been increasing over the expansion. The acceleration in the employment cost index over the past two years suggests that the anecdotal reports of firms raising wages to attract and retain workers are now filtering through into the official statistics. Should investment remain strong, we may see stronger productivity growth over time, which should help buoy wages, although that remains to be seen. Inflation has been firming, with year-over-year total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation rising to 2 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, in March. Some of the pickup reflects higher commodity prices, and some of the strength is likely to be temporary as low readings of last March drop out of the calculations. To assess where we are relative to goal, it\\u2019s always a good idea to look through transitory movements in the numbers and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. A variety of models, including the Cleveland Fed staff\\u2019s BVAR models and the Tealbook, are now forecasting inflation to be at or above 2 percent for a time. The fact that inflation expectations have been broadly stable supports the forecast that inflation will continue to firm. Conditional on the outlook, the task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy economy to sustain the expansion. Monetary policy is still accommodative. Real rates are negative even though the economic outlook is strong. The set of simple monetary May 1\\u20132, 2018 69 of 185 policy rules across several forecasts that are available on the Cleveland Fed\\u2019s external website indicates that policy rates should be rising. Running the rules through updated forecasts gives a median path across the rules and forecasts that is somewhat steeper than the median path in the March Summary of Economic Projections. As the economy strengthens, we want to avoid a buildup in risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. Recent Cleveland Fed staff research suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to pull more people back into the workforce is unlikely to have any lasting effect on labor force participation. Yet overheating would have costs that would necessitate sharper rate increases that could in themselves be destabilizing. At the same time, we also want to avoid raising rates too aggressively, which could potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing. In the current environment, I think there\\u2019s more risk we\\u2019ll move rates up too slowly than too quickly, and I continue to think that the path of gradual rate increases, which we\\u2019ve been on for some time, remains appropriate. I think we should communicate this base case as clearly as possible so that the markets continue to place high odds on the gradual policy rate path. Clear communication will help avoid the situation in which market expectations are undermined by news that\\u2019s irrelevant to the medium-run outlook. Recently, market participants have seemed to react strongly to all sorts of news, so I don\\u2019t see this as an insignificant risk. I wouldn\\u2019t want to find ourselves in a situation where we feel somewhat constrained because of changing market expectations, even though the outlook hasn\\u2019t changed. Over the remainder of the year, especially at the three remaining press conference meetings, I will be biased toward favoring a further reduction in accommodation if economic data and the medium-run outlook are supportive. That is, the burden of proof will lie on delaying a rate increase, not on taking one. In my view, thinking of the gradual path as a base May 1\\u20132, 2018 70 of 185 case will help prevent us from placing too much emphasis on short-run movements in the data and from getting \\u201cbehind the curve.\\u201d Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Barkin. Thanks. I agree with others that we remain on a good path. Output growth is above trend. We have strong employment growth, while unemployment remains historically low and inflation is effectively at our target. From our standpoint, it may well be this is as good as it gets. In that context, I want to emphasize four points. First, while first-quarter consumer spending might not seem as clearly aligned with this story, our contacts assure me that underlying growth in this economy really is strong. Yes, the tariff talk has taken business sentiment down a notch, but it had been euphoric. Our contacts couldn\\u2019t be clearer that after a softish start to the year, they\\u2019re seeing real strength. More recent data from the end of the first quarter\\u2014for example, industrial production and retail sales\\u2014support that our economy has momentum. Second, while we clearly have labor market tightness, I\\u2019ve spent a lot of time, but I can\\u2019t yet find the evidence that that tightness is leading to more than moderate wage increases, other than in a few places like trade workers and truck drivers and the like. With inflation expectations anchored and productivity growth apparently limited, businesses are still of a mindset to aggressively work to defend against outsized wage pressure. Our contacts are clearly increasing compensation for entry-level hires, but that only affects a small and targeted segment of their workforce. We do see evidence they are being creative in bringing new profiles into the workforce\\u2014for example, one who has relaxed his posture on hiring workers with felony convictions. They\\u2019re using offshoring and automation as alternatives and are willing to delay filling positions. Where they do see broader pressure, they\\u2019re attempting to use temporary May 1\\u20132, 2018 71 of 185 measures\\u2014for example, one-time bonuses. I\\u2019d note, as I understand it, these aren\\u2019t captured in the hourly wage statistics, and perhaps that helps explain the greater rise we just saw in the ECI. More fundamentally, with attrition still manageable, they\\u2019re resisting the need to let increases flow to their greater workforce in ways that would meaningfully move the average. For example, a couple of recent union negotiations in our District resulted in 2 percent annual wage increases over five years. I remember clearly in both the late 1990s and the mid-2000s that attrition rose to levels where businesses like the one I ran had to gulp and take action. We\\u2019re watching closely to see if and when that happens here but haven\\u2019t really seen the evidence that it\\u2019s happening in a broad-based way. A third point: As Presidents Evans and Mester both said, we are seeing real input cost pressure in multiple places. Some of it\\u2019s driven by actual and expected tariff increases\\u2014for example, steel. Our contacts in that sector tell us that steel beam pricing is up 30 percent since December 1. Some of it is oil price driven\\u2014for example, in chemicals\\u2014and we\\u2019ve heard of similar pressures in linerboard, caustic soda, and pulp. And, of course, notably, we see increase in freight prices and challenges in trucker availability with its corresponding pressure on supply chains. Finally, while price inflation is now at target, I still don\\u2019t have any sense it\\u2019s about to take off in a much more significant way. Despite input cost pressures, I view pricing as more expectations driven than cost driven, as I discussed in March. Our policies are keeping expectations anchored, and customers are not receptive to outsized price increases without a visible driver. That driver is there in the commodity industries I just discussed, but not in the consumer-facing sector in which price transparency and buyer power really matter. Likewise, that driver seems to be absent in areas such as utilities in which, as I discussed in January, part of May 1\\u20132, 2018 72 of 185 the tax cut is being passed on to consumers. Net\\u2013net, our economy has real strength and momentum, which I believe is helping keep inflation firm. We\\u2019ve also embedded a set of expectations that I believe will keep it manageable. Thank you. Governor Brainard. Thank you. Although intermeeting indicators of real economic activity have been somewhat on the soft side and financial conditions have tightened a bit, my outlook for the remainder of the year remains broadly unchanged. Nonetheless, there are uncertainties that could complicate our task in both directions. In particular, it\\u2019s hard to assess the likely course of trade policy and the extent to which markets are pricing in the risks. In addition, we have little historical experience with procyclical fiscal stimulus of the magnitude expected in the near term, and there is some uncertainty about its path in the medium term and beyond. As of Friday, real GDP was estimated to have grown at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter. This is quite a respectable pace considering the residual seasonality that has clouded first-quarter growth readings in recent years. While consumption posted anemic growth of 1.1 percent, which was a sharp step-down from the fourth-quarter pace, business investment continued last year\\u2019s impressive gains. And, of course, the report was quite strong and above expectations on net exports. Fundamentally, intermeeting developments didn\\u2019t change the outlook, in my view. I expect the slowdown in consumer spending growth to prove transitory, as the fundamentals facing households remain quite positive. Consumer confidence remains very high, and employment prospects remain bright. May 1\\u20132, 2018 73 of 185 Although payroll employment rose only about 100,000 in March, the picture looks stronger for the first quarter as a whole, with payroll gains averaging 200,000 per month and the employment-to-population ratio moving up. The unemployment rate has now remained flat at 4.1 percent for six consecutive months. While that\\u2019s below most estimates of the natural rate, this could reflect, in part, changes in the educational attainment of the workforce. Other measures of labor market utilization, such as the prime-age EPOP ratio, remain notably lower than their pre-crisis levels, although, as I noted, they\\u2019re starting to move up. While it\\u2019s difficult to know with precision how much slack still remains, Friday\\u2019s reading on the employment cost index provides some evidence that labor markets are tightening and wages are accelerating, albeit at a measured pace. The first-quarter reading on the trailing 12-month change was 2.8 percent, up from 2.3 percent in the year-earlier period. By comparison, in the years before the financial crisis, the ECI rose at an annual rate of a bit more than 3 percent on average. In the period ahead, I will be looking for confirmation in other measures of nominal wage growth that labor market tightness is finally feeding through to broadening wage gains. In particular, the latest readings on gains in both average hourly earnings and the Atlanta Fed wage tracker remain in the range of recent years, and I would expect those also to show some acceleration. Turning to global factors, foreign growth remained robust overall, although a bit weaker than forecast. Emerging Asian economies, led by China, are likely to post solid gains in the first quarter. Closer to home, Mexico looks likely to post a second consecutive quarter of 3 percent growth, and Canada\\u2019s real GDP growth is projected to have picked up. But Japan and some European countries look to have grown somewhat less rapidly early this year than we expected. Partly as a result, monetary policies among the advanced economies look likely to be May 1\\u20132, 2018 74 of 185 increasingly divergent. With underlying inflation in the euro zone remaining stubbornly low and first-quarter growth coming in softer than anticipated, the ECB has indicated it will maintain a very prudent course. And in Japan, with inflation continuing to run well below the 2 percent objective, changes to the yield curve control policy and rate hikes seem very remote. Consistent with these developments, the foreign exchange value of the dollar in real trade-weighted terms is up about \\u00be percentage point from the March meeting. But, of course, it\\u2019s still much lower than its 2016 peak. This is part of a broader picture where financial conditions have tightened somewhat during the intermeeting period, moving more in line with the expectation of continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate than we observed for much of last year. In particular, longer-term Treasury yields have risen, and the 10-year yield increased 60 basis points so far and crossed the 3 percent threshold for the first time in four years. Similarly, equity prices are down 1\\u00be percent since March and flat so far this year, but still up nearly 20 percent relative to the end of 2016. On net, even with these recent moves, financial conditions remain quite supportive of aggregate demand. The latest readings on inflation, as others have noted, have been encouraging. In the March data, the trailing 12-month change in core PCE was 1.9 percent. That was entirely in line with expectations as the depressed readings associated with last spring\\u2019s cell phone plan changes fell out of the data. We have also seen improvement in market-based measures of inflation compensation with the five-year, five-year-forward moving up 12 basis points in the intermeeting period, although it\\u2019s still somewhat short of the levels that prevailed in the decade before 2014. Meanwhile, the Michigan consumer surveys remain range bound at the lower end of historical observations. And some alternative measures of core inflation don\\u2019t show the same May 1\\u20132, 2018 75 of 185 upward movement that we\\u2019ve seen in core PCE. Even the Dallas Fed\\u2019s trimmed mean shows that the latest 12-month reading is unchanged from a year earlier. The Tealbook forecast has core PCE inflation at around 2 percent for the year as a whole, and then moving modestly higher. But it\\u2019s important to note that this forecast relies on a judgmental adjustment to the Phillips curve according to which the responsiveness of inflation rises as the unemployment rate moves further below the natural rate, as well as a judgmental 10 basis point increase in the underlying trend inflation rate over the next two years. In short, while it\\u2019s reassuring to see core PCE inflation moving back to target, as well as market-based measures of inflation compensation retracing earlier declines, after seven long years of missing our target and with wages only rising modestly, it would be mistaken to declare victory or materially shift upward our expected path of the policy rate at this point. More broadly, while we can comfortably assess risks to the outlook as roughly balanced, nonetheless, important risks remain on both sides. Turning to the clearest policy risks, trade policy continues to pose a material uncertainty. While targeted trade measures that result in negotiated outcomes should have little effect on the outlook, any broadening dynamic of retaliation and counterretaliation could unsettle equity markets, damp global confidence, and disrupt supply chains, as Beth Anne pointed out earlier. Second, the staff estimates that fiscal impetus will contribute about \\u00bd percentage point to real GDP growth this year and \\u00be percentage point next year\\u2014and CBO estimates that are similar\\u2014coincide with a time when the economy is already close to full employment and growing above its trend rate. It\\u2019s hard to know with precision how the economy is likely to respond, because there are very few cases of such procyclical fiscal stimulus at similarly high levels of resource utilization. If resource utilization continues to tighten at the rate of the past May 1\\u20132, 2018 76 of 185 year, it could reach levels not seen in several decades\\u2014for instance, as is the case in the Tealbook baseline projection. Beyond that, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the likely path of fiscal policy in the medium term, because the recently enacted Bipartisan Budget Act doesn\\u2019t set appropriation levels for fiscal 2020 and beyond. While the Tealbook baseline assumes spending continues to rise with inflation, this would require spending legislation to be enacted in the summer or fall of 2019, a tricky time. Furthermore, CBO projections suggest that budget deficits will be high and rising toward 5 percent, which may prompt fiscal fears to be back in focus. There is, therefore, a nontrivial risk of a reduction in fiscal support coming at a time when the economy may be slowing. The implied fiscal impetus in the CBO baseline, for instance, drops from nearly \\u00be percentage point in 2018 and 2019 to only 0.1 percentage point in 2020. A large increase in fiscal support late in the cycle followed by a sharp withdrawal could present us with a difficult set of crosswinds as we attempt to navigate a soft landing. On the other side, there is quite a bit of likelihood that a large portion of today\\u2019s fiscal stimulus could be extended, which could raise concerns about fiscal sustainability over time. And, of course, the drawing down of fiscal space during good times creates the risk that there will be less fiscal space to cushion a cyclical downturn in the future\\u2014a situation that has very important implications for monetary policy. Thank you. Thank you. President Kaplan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The 11th District economy continues to grow at a strong pace. We are expecting Texas job growth in 2018 to exceed 3 percent. This growth is helped by strength in the energy sector but is well diversified across industries. As we have said before, migration of people and firms to Texas continues to be a big part of the 11th District\\u2019s growth story. The state\\u2019s unemployment rate now stands at 4 percent, which is very May 1\\u20132, 2018 77 of 185 near the lowest level since data started being recorded in the 1970s. Labor market conditions are clearly tightening, and an increasing percentage of our manufacturing, retail, and service-sector firms that we survey have indicated they are raising wages. However, in follow-up with contacts, it\\u2019s clear, in our judgment, that it\\u2019s most pronounced at the low end\\u2014that is, $10 to $15 an hour\\u2014and at the skilled level, and is less pronounced in the middle. I\\u2019ll come back to that. Dallas Fed economists expect U.S. crude oil production to grow a million barrels a day in 2018. We\\u2019ve mentioned that forecast before. We think we will end the year in the United States at 11 million barrels per day. We expect, as we have said before, that 70 percent of this production is likely to come from the Permian. We are hearing increasingly that labor shortages are cited at the greatest threat to increased production. Also, industry executives cite the greater discipline that is being demanded by capital providers as another constraint to production growth. We continue to be more confident in our assessments of global daily demand growth. It is now in excess of 1.5 million barrels a day, and we expect that increased shale production will be unable to keep up with global demand growth. Assuming that OPEC continues to maintain production discipline and agreed cuts, we think, as we\\u2019ve said before, oil price risk is to the upside. Stepping back a bit, we went from a global oversupply situation in 2014 to a current global situation of relative balance, taking into account OPEC supply restrictions. However, Dallas Fed economists and our industry contacts are increasingly of the view that in the next few years we will likely move to a global undersupply situation. The fact that major oil companies have not and are not making meaningful investments in long-lived capital projects and are instead relying on shale investments make this undersupply scenario much more likely. This May 1\\u20132, 2018 78 of 185 situation means that global oil markets are going to be particularly vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and disruptions. Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela are all examples. And this all creates oil price risk to the upside. If this risk is realized and oil prices materially increase, it obviously has implications for consumers, inflation, and economic conditions. This story, though, is part of a broader narrative that many of you have mentioned today about rising input costs. Shipping costs are up. Steel costs are up. Aluminum and labor costs are up. The potential for more tariffs could further increase costs. We are talking to more and more companies that are attempting to pass through price increases, but this is an ongoing theme of increasing input costs. For the U.S. economy, our Dallas Fed economists continue to expect real GDP growth in excess of 2\\u00bd percent, but we do continue to expect this growth to moderate in 2019 and move toward potential in 2020, mainly because of aging workforce demographics, continued sluggish productivity due to lagging education and skill levels, and other structural challenges that are likely to create headwinds for economic growth in the medium term. We continue to believe, though, as most of you have said, that unemployment this year is going to move well below 4 percent. We do believe PCE inflation is going to meet or exceed 2 percent. It is correct that the Dallas trimmed mean now stands at 1.8 percent, which is the same as it was a year ago, but it has been moving up in recent months. We\\u2019ve had an unusual situation. We talk a lot about March 2017 being weak. However, if you go back a year earlier, according to our numbers, April 2016 was unusually strong. So the reason that the Dallas trimmed mean looks like it\\u2019s the same year over year is that it was artificially strong a year ago. I don\\u2019t need to go through what happened with March, because we\\u2019ve beat it to death. Our May 1\\u20132, 2018 79 of 185 Dallas trimmed mean has actually been moving up, and we believe even that measure is going to start migrating to 2 percent. Our contacts emphasize broadly that business spending is strong. They characterize consumer spending, on the other hand, as solid but price sensitive. And the other comment I\\u2019m hearing from more and more calls with consumer-facing companies is that they segment their customers between the upper 20 percent and everyone else. There\\u2019s very healthy growth in the first segment, and, certainly, we see this in luxury brands and anything that caters to upper-income consumers. However, when you talk about the rest, most contacts see those consumers standing pat, spending but not materially increasing their spending, and monitoring their personal leverage. And to explain why consumer spending growth isn\\u2019t greater in this group, our contacts are guessing that recent trade policy rhetoric, stock market volatility, and overall news volatility may be causing these middle-level consumers to be somewhat more cautious in their spending. They have also posited a view that these consumers are starting to realize that these $1,000 bonuses they have been receiving in their jobs may well be one-off, and they would be wise to not assume that recent legislation will in fact translate into greater nominal wage growth. There\\u2019s more skepticism about that, and we may be seeing that belief in consumer spending. Another comment I\\u2019d make is, several public company contacts I talk to\\u2014and I\\u2019ve mentioned this before over the past couple of years\\u2014are talking as much as ever about the role of activist investors in influencing their decisions to spend on cap-ex, expand capacity, and invest in their workforce versus focusing on cash flow to do mergers, share repurchase, and dividends. As I have mentioned here before, the presence of activists is shortening the time frame of most CEOs. Today, if a company has an extended period of weakness in the share May 1\\u20132, 2018 80 of 185 price, a CEO is likely to find an activist in his or her stock insisting on cost reductions, breakup of the business, increased financial engineering, and the like. This trend, from what I can tell, is intensifying and may help explain why merger activity is so pronounced. Also, technologyenabled disruption, a lack of pricing power, and increasing desire for scale but thin margins fit right into this narrative. One additional comment: I went with members of my team to China in the past couple of weeks and have a few observations. Number one, U.S. companies doing business in China clearly report stronger domestic competitors. In addition, despite public comments to the contrary, China is continuing to use debt to fuel at least a portion of its economic growth. But more interestingly, the Chinese are\\u2014and have been for a number of years\\u2014making long-term investments\\u2014that I would argue maybe we\\u2019re not making in the United States\\u2014in technology, education of their citizens, and in other steps to improve their global competitiveness. They are also aggressively stepping in around the world to make greater investments and, maybe disturbingly, change global standards to fit their products, moving away from Western standards. While reciprocal tariffs are being publicly discussed, Western companies we met with there are far more concerned with issues related to intellectual property and technology transfer for fear that China is using those properties and technology to improve its global competitiveness dramatically and compete with Western companies around the world and will do so in the years ahead. Last comment: All of this highlights the potential need for the United States to segment trade relationships. Our trade relationships with Mexico and Canada are very different from our trade relationship with China. And as I\\u2019ve said here before, our research suggests that the Mexico\\u2013Canada trading relationships are heavily tilted toward intermediate goods and involve May 1\\u20132, 2018 81 of 185 complex logistics and supply chain arrangements. Our own research suggests that trade with Mexico and Canada helps U.S. companies be more globally competitive and retain jobs. And those jobs, we believe, would otherwise be lost to other parts of the world, particularly to Asia, if we didn\\u2019t have these relationships. And as we are dealing with the rise of China, strengthening these Northern Hemisphere trading relationships is as important as it has ever been. Maybe it is something we have to prioritize a little more. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Harker. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Over the intermeeting period, economic growth in the Third District has been consistent with trend. Labor markets remain quite healthy, with both current hiring and planned hiring above average rates. Consumption, though, has tapered off, but confidence remains extremely high, and the first-quarter weakness will most likely be temporary. However, we have yet to see much pickup in housing starts or permits in our District, and our District will probably continue to lag the nation on this dimension. Contacts, especially those in manufacturing, continue to be quite upbeat, and I am anticipating at- or above-trend growth over the remainder of the year. The District continues to add jobs at a pace exceeding that of the nation. For example, one health-care provider in the District added more than 1,000 professionals last year, the majority being nurses, and has similar hiring plans for this year. As President Williams can attest, it\\u2019s good to have a nurse in the family. [Laughter] This type of strength in our labor market is unusual for our region because our region usually underperforms the nation. However, unemployment rates have remained constant at 4.7 percent as more individuals have been drawn into the labor force. Also, with the exception of manufacturing, we are not seeing any acceleration in wage growth. Regarding manufacturing, contacts remain extremely optimistic, and activity has picked up. The current employment index May 1\\u20132, 2018 82 of 185 in our manufacturing survey is in historically high territory, as is the future employment index. Overall, the general activity index remains solidly in expansionary territory. Bankers in the region report that their business customers are doing well and that the effects of the tax cut have not fully worked their way through the economy. They anticipate that business activity will continue to expand. A knowledgeable business contact with a broad portfolio of manufactured products reports that activity is robust worldwide, with orders and backlogs up across a wide range of products. To use a technical phrase, he is \\u201calmost giddy\\u201d with what he is seeing. He states that backlogs are actually at historic highs and quarter two is looking stronger than quarter one, with all signs pointing to an exceptionally strong third quarter as well. And one sign that he brought up in our meeting recently was that he\\u2019s running delays in shipments because of these backlogs. Normally, he would get calls with complaints from his customers. His take is, he\\u2019s not, because everybody globally is running these delays. All his global competitors are seeing very similar backlogs and the inability to meet the time targets they have set out. At this level of activity, he anticipated midyear price increases in the neighborhood of 3 percent. His firms are raising wages as well in an attempt to put a firewall around employees, particularly IT workers and engineers. With robust growth, those firms cannot afford to lose key employees. Consistent with our contact\\u2019s view, our prices received indexes, both current and future, are indicating increased price pressures. Contacts are also reporting additional uncertainty largely due to potential tariffs and retaliations they could provoke. However, as others have said, the uncertainty has not risen to a level where it is significantly affecting their plans yet. Consumption activity continues to be somewhat lackluster, and the general activity index for services has fallen a tad below average, with both sales and new orders declining. But with May 1\\u20132, 2018 83 of 185 very optimistic consumers, healthy job growth, and rising income, I anticipate this lull to be temporary. Regarding residential housing markets, they have yet to gather significant momentum, and single-family permits have been flat for more than two years. There appear to be severe supply constraints in the housing market, with reports of existing homes remaining on the market for a matter of hours. Inventories of existing homes for sale continue to plummet. Overall, however, the trend in activity remains positive. And due to multifamily construction and renovation, contract values for residential buildings remain at high levels. To conclude: Growth in the Third District has picked up to or is at, or above, trend levels, and fundamentals remain strong. We anticipate some rebound this quarter, and that is my view of the national economy as well. With the exception of the projected funds rate path, I see little to quibble with in the staff\\u2019s assessment of the economy in the Tealbook. In addition, I am becoming increasingly confident that inflation will likely exceed our target sometime this. year. As my confidence level increases, I will need to reassess my view that only three rate hikes are appropriate for this year. I\\u2019ll return to those thoughts tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President George. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Economic conditions in the 10th District remain strong, and our District contacts are generally upbeat about the outlook. Job growth in the District increased in March from a year ago, supported by solid contributions made by states that benefited from a strengthening energy sector. Personal income and wage growth also strengthened in the last quarter of 2017 as wages increased notably in all District states. With the price of oil well above the breakeven price required for profitable drilling among District firms, the number of active drilling rigs in the District is about 20 percent higher than a year ago. Manufacturing has also remained strong in the District despite some concerns about May 1\\u20132, 2018 84 of 185 developments in trade policy. Our District\\u2019s manufacturing survey in April showed the strongest activity in its 24-year history, even as respondents noted that input costs have surged alongside significant increases in steel prices. Agriculture, on the other hand, remains the weakest sector in the District economy. Although farm income and credit conditions have continued to stabilize, ongoing cash flow shortages appear to be increasingly weighing on bankers\\u2019 decisions to extend credit. Finally, trade policy concerns continue to be highlighted by our contacts in the District. For example, in the construction industry, contacts report that rising input costs have prompted contract renegotiations, along with the postponement or even cancellation of some projects. In the agricultural sector, recent announcements by China to raise tariffs on key agricultural products have raised concern about U.S. competitiveness in some agricultural markets in the long term, although short-term effects are expected to be relatively small, as trade flows are likely to simply reshuffle in response to changes in tariffs. Turning to the national economy: My outlook for real GDP growth has changed little since our previous meeting. Despite softness in Q1 consumer spending, the latest data releases point to a rebound in consumption in Q2. And more broadly, households and businesses appear well positioned to support real GDP growth that is at or slightly above the trend rate, accompanied by a tightening labor market and a gradual rise in nominal wage growth. As the labor market tightens and reports of worker shortages grow, I asked my staff to look at the current moderate pace of wage growth for its signal of additional slack in the labor market\\u2014 whether it\\u2019s consistent with broader forces in the economy. One observation comes from the San Francisco Fed\\u2019s wage rigidity meter, in which a significant number of workers report that their wages have not been adjusted over the past year. This measure remains at historically high May 1\\u20132, 2018 85 of 185 levels and actually ticked up through most of 2017. Limited or no wage growth for a subset of workers may be related to the low levels of labor productivity growth for the economy during the current expansion. Analysis by my staff suggests that such nominal wage rigidities have persistent effects on wage growth even a year later. Current readings on nominal wage growth, relative to wage rigidity a year ago, are right in line with the historical pattern over the past two decades. Thus, it may not be surprising to see moderate nominal wage growth despite a low unemployment rate. Finally, I expect year-over-year inflation to reach 2 percent in the current quarter, with some upside risk over the medium term as the momentum for economic growth in the United States and the global economy continues. Whether inflation moves significantly higher over the forecast horizon is difficult to judge. But our District contacts did point to meaningful price pressures in a couple of areas and seem quite confident in their ability to pass these higher prices on to consumers. One source of price pressure is rising shipping costs for both domestic and international transportation. The Harpex shipping index, which tracks worldwide international container shipping rates, has increased rapidly since January. Importantly, these international shipping costs are generally not included in the U.S. import price indexes, but importers can pass changes in shipping costs through to consumers in a manner that affects aggregate price growth. Research by my staff shows that an increase of 25 percent in the Harpex index, as we have seen this year, can lead to a rise of 15 basis points on core PCE inflation after a year. Similarly, rail and truck transportation costs have also increased, which is consistent with the anecdotes I hear from our District business contacts. The other source of upside risk to inflation comes from rising energy prices. Strong U.S. and global demand have contributed to an increase in oil prices, which have risen more than 25 percent over the past six months. If oil prices May 1\\u20132, 2018 86 of 185 remain at this level or move even higher, these higher energy costs are likely to put upward pressure on core prices in coming periods. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Bostic. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The accumulated evidence since our previous meeting hasn\\u2019t been sufficiently far from my expectations to push me off the projections I submitted for the March SEP. Most Sixth District directors and contacts are similarly looking past some of the weaker-than-expected first-quarter data and continue to report activity levels consistent with a moderate pace of output growth. While my contacts appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current state of the economy, their attitude shifts markedly when asked about the future. Swelling optimism over the tax reform has now been replaced almost completely by concerns and uncertainty regarding the proposed tariffs and the possibility of a trade war. To quote one director, \\u201cThe bandwidth of unknowns is vastly greater than it used to be.\\u201d I had speculated in the previous meeting that the surge in pessimism we saw late in the cycle may just be a reflection of the freshness of the news. My hope was that the negative sentiment would abate quickly. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case. If anything, these concerns appear to have escalated, consuming many of the discussions I have had with my contacts. Though there are exceptions, I come away with the sense that, for now, most firms are moving to the sidelines with respect to new cap-ex plans. To quote another director, \\u201cEven if all of this trade talk ends up being just noise, noise itself has a tangible cost.\\u201d I have gathered little indication that firms are pulling back on investment projects that are already in progress. But investment projects slated for the pipeline have been pushed out. The head of a global logistics and shipping firm noted that the prospect of trade wars has totally May 1\\u20132, 2018 87 of 185 affected his cap-ex plans moving forward over the next 10 years. He indicated that planning that had already been under way for capital expansion to meet a rise in global demand has all but completely halted. All of this is fully consistent with the model presented by Beth Anne showing a market response, even if no trade war comes to pass. This already appears to be happening in some circles. On the consumer spending front, I, like the Board staff, am tempted to chalk up most of the weakness in the recent data to payback after a strong Q4. However, I received few, if any, reports of a noticeable acceleration in consumer spending attributable to the tax cuts. Retailers generally report steady sales growth overall, but our anecdotal reports are consistent with the survey data out of the New York Fed indicating that consumer expectations on future spending growth are relatively flat. On the plus side, the heightened uncertainty that firms appear to be feeling does not appear to be significantly affecting household sentiment. Qualitative evidence gathered by my regional economic intelligence network suggests that labor market conditions have not changed much in recent months. Like many here, I heard that labor markets are tight, but I see few signs of overheating. My view is that the natural rate has fallen and is a bit lower than the rate in the Tealbook projections, with the reduction being sparked in part by technological change in the job-search space. On balance, I still view the economy as being close to or at full employment, but I am not seeing an accumulation of evidence that would suggest the economy is significantly beyond the frontier. An interesting theme has developed in several of my conversations with business decisionmakers that may shed some light on the continuing puzzle of the disconnect between the weak productivity growth and the emphatic assertions by firms that productivity gains are evident in their operations. I am engaging in some speculation here, but it may be the case that May 1\\u20132, 2018 88 of 185 productivity gains at the level of production workers are being soaked up by a new line item, cyber expense. Efforts to stay \\u201cleft of the boom\\u201d\\u2014that is, to thwart cyberattacks before they occur\\u2014have accelerated markedly over this recovery. My contacts assure me that these efforts require an ever-increasing set of new capital and labor inputs just to keep pace with the surge in attacks. It stands to reason that these new inputs, much like hiring accountants and lawyers to keep up with the regulatory environment, do little to grow output. Regarding inflation, while most of my contacts continue to report little to no pricing power, we are beginning to discern a shift in sentiment. April data obtained from our Business Inflation Expectations survey reveal a sizable increase in reported unit cost pressures over the past few months. Despite the increase, nearly half of these firms see profit margins as being in line with what they would consider normal, and 15 percent reported above-normal margins. Interestingly, the majority of those with above-normal margins indicated that they had achieved margin growth by increasing prices. Reports on likely pricing pressure in the period ahead are mixed\\u2014like many have reported here today\\u2014with the most significant pricing power reported in businesses and sectors that are exposed to cost pressures associated with actual or potential tariffs. These are isolated and presumably transitory developments. Still, it is notable that longer-run business inflation expectations have risen to their highest level since shortly after QE3 began. As measured inflation is already effectively on target, I\\u2019m continuing to mark in a modest overshoot of target and still see the risk to that projection as being slightly to the upside. Overall, I view the economy as being on track and believe we are close to mandate-consistent outcomes for both inflation and employment. I will carry that thought over to my remarks on policy tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. May 1\\u20132, 2018 89 of 185 Thank you. President Bullard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Economic activity in the Eighth District has been improving at a moderate pace during the intermeeting period. District banks increased lending activity during this period in large part by lending in the commercial real estate sector. There continues to be a resurgence of hotel construction in the District. Industry contacts suggested that demand for hotel rooms has been particularly robust. Much of the new construction is for smaller boutique hotels, defined as fewer than 100 rooms. The outlook for inflation appears to be subdued. District contacts, while acknowledging the strong economy, generally did not stress pricing pressures during the intermeeting period. Members of the Eighth District Health Care Industry Council noted that cost-cutting pressures in their industry are very strong, driven by little or no growth in Medicare spending. According to the agricultural sector, many contacts indicated that planting delays are commonplace, in a cold, wet spring. This sector is quite concerned about the potential for a trade war with China. Regarding the national outlook, I have just a few comments on inflation. The main news on inflation is that headline PCE inflation measured from one year earlier is now 2 percent, and core PCE inflation measured from one year earlier is 1.9 percent. In central banking, this is about the best that can be achieved, so we should probably take a brief moment to celebrate our victory. In this respect, Mr. Chairman, I\\u2019m expecting a very high quality champagne at our event tonight. [Laughter] In truth, however\\u2014and I\\u2019m going to channel Governor Brainard here a little bit\\u2014this event has been a long time coming, as neither headline nor core PCE inflation has been meaningfully above our 2 percent target since 2011. That is six years below target, a time during which the Committee, including me, consistently forecast an imminent return of inflation. May 1\\u20132, 2018 90 of 185 The unemployment rate in the United States fell below 5 percent in the fall of 2015\\u2014 more than 2\\u00bd years ago\\u2014an event that, by conventional accounts of the Phillips curve, should have presaged increasing inflationary pressure. That pressure never really materialized, a clear indication in my mind of just how weak these effects really are in the current macroeconomic environment. In light of these events, it does not seem prudent to me to bet heavily on the idea that Phillips curve mechanisms will now become significantly stronger. Instead, it seems to me that the baseline case should be for very weak Phillips curve mechanisms in the future. In concise terms, an economy growing at 3 percent is not very different from an economy growing at 2 percent in terms of inflationary effect, in our current environment. In addition, this Committee has already been preemptive in trying to control those very minor inflationary effects by normalizing the policy rate substantially and by allowing the balance sheet to begin to shrink. In the meantime, the six-year low-side miss on inflation has arguably taken a toll on inflation expectations. Five-year TIPS-based inflation compensation is now about 2 percent, but that is on a CPI basis. If we adjust that expectation down 30 basis points to get something comparable to PCE inflation expectations, we see that markets still do not expect this Committee to achieve the inflation target on a PCE basis over the next five years. This is all the more surprising, as financial markets, generally speaking, have a less aggressive monetary policy penciled in compared with the median policy rate path of the Committee. I think a prudent policy at this point would be to let the five-year market-based inflation expectations firm somewhat, perhaps to 2.3 percent or somewhat higher, and then see how the economy evolves from there and adjust monetary policy in response to macroeconomic surprises from that point. May 1\\u20132, 2018 91 of 185 Let me now turn to yield curve issues very briefly. The slope of the yield curve is perfectly fine today. The 10-year\\u20131-year difference is about 70 basis points, and that\\u2019s very normal. Recession probabilities calculated using that kind of yield curve data are low today, indicating only a low probability of recession 6 or 12 or 18 months in the future. The issue for the yield curve is not today, but for later this year or early in 2019. If the Committee proceeds with three additional policy rate increases this year and the long end of the curve does not cooperate, we will have a yield curve inversion. If we get to that point, it may be too late to do much about it, owing to the lagged effects of monetary policy. Typical estimates of simple models using U.S. postwar data suggest a recession would begin as early as one or two quarters after that inversion or, if not, almost certainly within seven or eight quarters. Of course, it\\u2019s possible that this time will be different, but I would not make a bet on that direction, as we do not have an inflation problem in the United States at this point. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Kashkari. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Starting with the Ninth District economy, moderate growth continues in the region. Demand for labor remains strong overall, with staffing firms reporting difficulty finding workers. There are numerous reports that some local suppliers are using the threat of tariffs as an excuse to raise prices now for steel and aluminum products. Our Bakken region of North Dakota is booming, but across the rest of the District, agriculture continues to struggle with low prices. Regarding the national economy, recent economic growth has been somewhat disappointing, but I think the outlook remains generally positive, taking into account various tailwinds: the fiscal stimulus, high asset prices, and high consumer and business confidence. There are some headwinds, however, in particular talk of tariffs and a trade war. Three or four May 1\\u20132, 2018 92 of 185 months ago everyone wanted to talk about optimism due to the tax cuts. That has now been replaced with concerns about the tariffs. But I think in both cases I wasn\\u2019t seeing much translation into action. It was just more a sense of optimism being replaced by a sense of concern. Furthermore, rising oil prices may now take a toll, and I\\u2019m hearing more concerns about a fairly aggressive rate path on the part of the FOMC and the effect we could have on the economy. Regarding financial markets, there is an ongoing increase in longer-term nominal rates since the start of the year, but it\\u2019s difficult to decompose any of the effects of larger expected deficits versus faster economic growth and higher inflation expectations. I think our rate path is obviously having a lot of effect on the shorter end, and, like President Bullard said, I continue to be very focused on the yield curve. I look at the 10-year\\u20132-year yield spread at around 50 basis points, and that is something I\\u2019m going to return to in my discussion tomorrow. I continue to pay close attention to labor markets. In my view, the amount of labor market slack is still uncertain: I think we\\u2019re quite uncertain about the trend labor force participation and about the natural rate of unemployment. The staff\\u2019s view at present is that the unemployment rate is 0.6 percentage point below the natural rate and that the current labor force participation rate is also significantly above trend. Personally, I find the idea that we\\u2019re operating well above full employment hard to square with the modest nominal wage growth that we\\u2019re seeing. On the labor force participation front, I expect that the healthy labor market will continue to draw people into employment from outside the labor force, as has happened over the past few years. I\\u2019ve said this before, and I think you all have heard this. Prime-age labor force participation has recovered to pre-recession levels in many other OECD countries. I see no May 1\\u20132, 2018 93 of 185 reason why the same should not happen here. As Governor Brainard mentioned, among all the different labor market indicators we monitor, I think we should pay especially close attention to the prime-age employment-to-population ratio. Work done by my staff shows that in recent years, this indicator is closely connected to nominal wage growth, and so it might be useful in predicting incoming inflation. Interestingly, this indicator is still 1 percentage point below the 2006 peak and 2 percentage points below the 1999 peak. As I travel around, like all of you, businesses are declaring historic worker shortages. You\\u2019ve got the Wall Street Journal echoing these hyperbolic views, and yet, at the same time, I haven\\u2019t heard anybody say that there\\u2019s an oil shortage. The price of oil has more than doubled, and that\\u2019s just the market adjusting. However, if firms can\\u2019t find workers at wages they\\u2019re used to paying, all of a sudden that\\u2019s a historic worker shortage. At the same time I was listening to this discussion, it occurred to me there are a whole bunch of likely presidential candidates for the next cycle who are out there now calling for a federal job guarantee. There\\u2019s a huge disconnect. If the need for a federal job guarantee is resonating with their constituents, it seems like there\\u2019s a very big disconnect between labor and the business community, and maybe between our view of maximum employment, or full employment. I think there are a lot of Americans who would say we\\u2019re not near maximum employment, as evidenced by the modest nominal wage growth. So for me it comes down to assessing wage growth. Inflation has continued to move up in recent months, and we\\u2019re now close to target. I think that\\u2019s welcome. After so many years below target, this is good news. To me, the fact that wage growth is slowly climbing at a time when core inflation is slowly climbing suggests it is signal, so I take that seriously. Market-based measures have also continued to move up. Some of the increased inflation over the past year reflects transitory effects of energy prices and dollar May 1\\u20132, 2018 94 of 185 depreciation, but, overall, I think it\\u2019s good news. Nominal wage growth remains modest. Higher nominal wage growth is going to be required to sustain our return to 2 percent inflation over the medium term. So, in summary, I think we\\u2019ve made important progress in getting inflation back to target. I hope this rise will prove to be persistent. I\\u2019ll feel more confident if we see more evidence that wage growth increases. On the labor market front, I agree we have made progress toward full employment, but I still think there may be slack, and the data are mixed. I don\\u2019t find plausible the Tealbook view that we are running well above full employment. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\u2019m pretty much with the consensus on the economic growth side. Although we\\u2019ve seen a modest slowing in real GDP growth in Q1, it looks to have been mainly because of payback for the surge in consumer spending that we saw in the fourth quarter following last fall\\u2019s hurricanes. The rebound that we saw in consumer spending in March coupled with the ongoing strength of payroll employment reinforces this conclusion. Also, the fact that fiscal policy is stimulative and financial markets are still easy points to a pickup in economic activity in the second quarter. On the inflation side, as many people have noted, we\\u2019re now close to our 2 percent objective. However, I would be less excited about this, because I think what we\\u2019re seeing to a large extent is just the opposite of what we saw a year ago. Just as core PCE inflation was held down a year ago by a few transitory factors\\u2014most notably the big drop in cellular phone services prices last March but also the softness in prescription drug prices\\u2014it now appears there are some other factors, also likely transitory, that are pushing upward in the opposite direction. May 1\\u20132, 2018 95 of 185 Rates of price increase both for hospital and nursing-home services and for financial services furnished without payment\\u2014think about that as deposit services\\u2014are rising quite sharply now on a year-over-year basis compared with a year earlier. Just to dig a bit deeper into the numbers: In March 2017, the year-over-year rate of increase in prices of hospital and nursing-home services was 1.8 percent. In March 2018, it had climbed to 3.3 percent. Now, this is a pretty big component of the PCE. It\\u2019s 10 percent of the weight of the PCE index. That has contributed nearly 0.2 percentage point to the increase that we have seen in core PCE inflation. Similarly, with respect to financial services furnished without payment, the year-over-year rate climbed to 7.5 percent in March of this year compared with 4 percent a year earlier. That\\u2019s contributing another tenth to the rise in core PCE inflation. My view is that we shouldn\\u2019t take too much signal from the recent pickup that we\\u2019ve seen. The rise in hospital and nursing-home services was primarily driven by a one-time increase in Medicare reimbursement rates in October followed by a rise in private insurance reimbursement rates a bit later. And the rise in the rate of increase in prices of financial services furnished without payment was due mainly to the rise in short-term interest rates relative to deposit rates\\u2014a pattern that typically occurs during the early stages of a tightening cycle when deposit rates lag behind changes in the federal funds rate. Most importantly, both of these increases don\\u2019t have strong ties back to labor resource utilization rates, and they can be quite volatile on a year-over-year basis. So what happens if we take out all of these factors? We take out hospital and nursing care, we take out financial services, we take out cellular phones, and we take out prescription drugs. We take out both sides. A year ago, core PCE inflation in March 2017, without all of these things, was 1.52 percent; core PCE inflation in March 2018 was 1.51 percent. I think we May 1\\u20132, 2018 96 of 185 just have to be a little bit cautionary not to put too much weight on the fact that we\\u2019ve gotten back to 1.9 percent for PCE inflation. In terms of the risk to the outlook, I\\u2019ll cite some of the risks that have already been mentioned. The first, I think, is obviously the trade side, which, depending on how it goes, could lead to higher trade barriers here and abroad. And as Beth Anne and others have pointed out, the result would be disruption to the supply chains, higher inflation, and slower productivity growth, which is not a good combination. Now, I\\u2019m pretty confident that this is not where the Administration wants to end up. I don\\u2019t think any Administration would want to end up there, but that doesn\\u2019t mean it won\\u2019t happen. As I see it, the Administration\\u2019s goal\\u2014the benign outcome\\u2014is to realign trade so that the United States is on a more level playing field with its major trading partners, such as China. I spoke to one senior Administration official, and how he explained it to me is that the United States has made concessions on trade over several decades essentially intended to induce other nations to embrace a more open trade regime. But that has ultimately resulted in an underlying misalignment in which the United States faces higher trade barriers than our trading partners face on our end. In this benign version of intent and goals, if the Administration were successful, we would end up both with the United States facing lower trade barriers and with lower trade barriers for the global economy as a whole. So we\\u2019ll see whether we move in this direction\\u2014 which is a benign outcome\\u2014or toward higher trade barriers here and abroad. But it is certainly a big risk to the outlook. The second risk, of course, is the unsustainability of the nation\\u2019s fiscal trajectory. This is one reason why I don\\u2019t want to talk about how good the economy is today, because I think this is going to be a really big problem for the economy down the road. Since our previous meeting, May 1\\u20132, 2018 97 of 185 the CBO has updated its 10-year budget projections. And, under current law, which includes the rollback of tax cut provisions over time and the reimposition of spending caps on discretionary spending\\u2014pretty favorable assumptions\\u2014the budget deficits are projected to be between 4\\u00bd and 5\\u00bd percent of GDP each year over the next decade. And if we had deficits like that, the debt-toGDP ratio would persistently increase over that period. Now, there are several reasons why this baseline is likely to be considerably too optimistic. First, as I mentioned, the projections assume that current laws maintain. Well, maintaining current law holds down the deficit projections in several ways. First, in the projections it\\u2019s assumed that the provisions of the tax law changes that are scheduled to lapse in the future do so. Recall that we had all of this lapsing of the tax provisions because that was the only way to shoehorn these tax cuts into the $1.5 trillion price tag over the 10-year budget window. Second, the CBO projections\\u2014and Governor Brainard alluded to this\\u2014are based on the assumption that defense and discretionary spending will drop in 2020 as the spending caps reassert themselves. That doesn\\u2019t seem very likely to me. The current CBO projections have defense spending falling to $651 billion in 2020 from $669 billion in 2019. This is a pretty sizable drop in defense spending; discretionary spending falls as well. And that\\u2019s all in nominal terms. Starting in 2022, all of these discretionary outlays are assumed to only rise at the inflation rate. So with those assumptions in place, discretionary outlays are projected to decline to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2028. That\\u2019s down a full percentage point from discretionary outlays in 2018. I would take the over, rather than the under, on that particular projection. These 10-year budget projections also are based on the assumption of steady economic growth, with no recession. Economic downturns inevitably are going to occur, And when that happens, that\\u2019s May 1\\u20132, 2018 98 of 185 going to lead to lower revenues, increased outlays, and more debt, and that\\u2019s going to worsen the fiscal path over time. Third, I think businesses may adjust their business models and how they structure their businesses in legal forms in order to reduce their income tax liabilities. Just as the tax cuts could lead to somewhat higher tax revenue arising from faster GDP growth, which were built into the CBO projections, tax revenues could be reduced as businesses adjust to minimize their liabilities. The bottom line is, if fiscal policy is not put proactively on a more sustainable course, a budgetary crisis will probably be the likely means of forcing the necessary adjustment. I think we have to recognize that an unsustainable fiscal path puts more pressure on us\\u2014or you. [Laughter] The pressure is going to be for the central bank to allow more inflation to reduce the real burden of the debt if we\\u2019re in that situation, and that\\u2019s, of course, something that we all must not do. Thank you. Thank you, and thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the outlook. I hear many of you saying that, on balance, the outlook has really not changed a great deal since the previous meeting and thus remains a strong one, and that is how I see it as well. Let me briefly summarize some of what I hear as main areas of agreement and then touch on some areas of risk. First, many of you are looking through the softness in first-quarter real GDP. The slowing was concentrated in PCE, but fundamentals, including strong job growth, fiscal stimulus, robust household and business confidence, and still-accommodative financial conditions, continue to point to above-trend growth in both consumer spending and business investment. Conditions abroad also remain generally favorable, although the apparent slowdown of growth in the euro area and Japan will bear watching. May 1\\u20132, 2018 99 of 185 Above-trend economic growth should lead to further labor market tightening, as many of you noted. Consistent with this view and despite some monthly fluctuations, payrolls rose a bit faster, on average, in the first quarter than in 2017. A rise in the labor force participation rate has accompanied job growth in recent months, keeping the unemployment rate steady. Strong labor force participation over the past few years has been a welcome surprise, and this strength can reasonably be expected to continue as long as growth in the economy remains solid. Of course, there\\u2019s no assurance of that. After the outsized declines of last March dropped from the 12-month calculation, PCE inflation has now moved close to 2 percent, consistent with our oft-expressed expectations. And I would note that a large number of you mentioned input cost pressures, along with varying degrees of ability to pass those increased costs through in prices. And that, too, is a positive development that supports increased confidence about the path of inflation, although let\\u2019s hope for not too much of a good thing. It is, of course, too early to declare victory, as many said, over several years of stubbornly low inflation. We need to see inflation return on a sustained basis to our symmetric 2 percent objective, and that mission is not yet accomplished. On a personal note, since I joined the FOMC in May 2012, there has not been a single month in which 12-month core PCE inflation has reached 2 percent. I am sitting here today 0 for 71 [laughter], and I look forward to ending that streak soon. As always, there are risks to the outlook and some differing views on how best to manage those risks. I would call out what I thought were particularly interesting, insightful, and thoughtprovoking alternative scenarios in the Tealbook. I think it is going to be hard to beat that set of scenarios\\u2014if I can say so\\u2014particularly the hysteresis one and the supply constraint one. May 1\\u20132, 2018 100 of 185 In view of the likely decline of unemployment to levels not seen in 50 years, we will need to be alert for signs of mounting inflationary pressures or of emerging financial imbalances. A number of you mentioned anecdotes of labor shortages and capacity limits. A tight labor market is likely to bring some benefits, for example, by supporting labor force participation or by assuring that inflation returns sustainably to 2 percent. Wage gains have continued to move up gradually but remain moderate even after accounting for weak productivity growth, providing little evidence of a significant overheating in the labor market so far. Trade is another risk that was prominently mentioned around the table today. Many of you said that you\\u2019re hearing from your business contacts about the risk of disruptive changes to trade policy. And while we\\u2019re not yet at the point at which these concerns are affecting the outlook, we\\u2019ll be watching this closely. I would point out that, as Beth Anne showed in her presentation, the program of protectionist measures is actually growing to quite a broad one at this point, particularly the confrontation with China. If you put it all together, the risks are certainly there\\u2014and, in my opinion, growing\\u2014that this will blossom into something that will have negative implications for the outlook. Turning to monetary policy, I would note that a number of you mentioned that financial conditions have tightened modestly, particularly with the dollar strengthening over the past couple of weeks and the 10-year rate moving up materially since the previous meeting. That, of course, is consistent with our normalization policy. I continue to see our gradual approach to removing accommodation as the appropriate way to balance the risk of overheating against the risk that we might move too fast and fail to bring inflation up to 2 percent on a sustained and symmetric basis. And that means keeping the target rate unchanged at this meeting while leaving the door open for a likely hike in June. May 1\\u20132, 2018 101 of 185 I\\u2019ll stop there. I suggest we move to Thomas, who will give us a look at monetary policy before we break for cocktails and dinner. Thomas. 5 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the handout labeled \\u201cMaterial for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.\\u201d Before I get started on my first exhibit, I would like to direct your attention to page 4, alternative B. On that page, you will see some language in blue in paragraph 1. You\\u2019ll recall that, in response to the Q1 NIPA release, yesterday we had circulated a version of alternative B that had switched that sentence back to all black\\u2014no changes. Subsequently, it was noted that the statement that business fixed investment moderated from strong fourth-quarter readings could be overinterpreted as suggesting that investment was no longer growing at a strong pace. It was, in fact, growing at 6.1 percent. So this sentence construction now pulls the household spending and BFI pieces apart, in order to give a slightly more nuanced description of the data, in which it is now stated that the \\u201cgrowth of household spending moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.\\u201d Regarding the first exhibit, your policy decisions at this meeting center on alternative B, which is a fairly straightforward update of the March statement. Under the bold assumption that you will adopt alternative B tomorrow, I will devote the bulk of my briefing to looking a bit further down the road. Many of you have suggested that some parts of the postmeeting statement be modified so as to keep it in line with the Committee\\u2019s evolving expectations of future monetary policy. As indicated in the Monetary Policy Alternatives section of the April Tealbook, alternative C has been written with this objective in mind and is intended to elicit your feedback on possible future statement language. The upper-left panel summarizes the principal changes in alternative C from the current version of alternative B. The main change in alternative C is to shift the focus of paragraph 4 to data dependence and to eliminate guidance that is no longer necessary or appropriate. The reference to \\u201cfurther gradual increases\\u201d in the federal funds rate would be moved to paragraph 2, where it serves to characterize a trajectory for the funds rate as \\u201cconsistent with sustained expansion of economic activity and employment and with inflation near . . . 2 percent.\\u201d The deletion of the part of the current guidance that \\u201cthe federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run\\u201d recognizes the likelihood that, over time, the federal funds rate will move gradually toward\\u2014and perhaps overshoot\\u2014its longerrun normal value. Nearly all of your March projections suggested that it would likely be appropriate for the federal funds rate to rise at least slightly above your estimates of its longer-run value at the end of the forecast period. The statement in the existing forward-guidance language may thus soon no longer be an accurate characterization of your outlook. 5 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). May 1\\u20132, 2018 102 of 185 Alternative C also raises the target range to 1\\u00be to 2 percent. To provide some perspective on the current and projected stance of monetary policy, the upper-right panel shows the historical evolution of the real federal funds rate (the black line) and the median of participants\\u2019 implied March SEP numbers for the real federal funds rate at the end of this year and the next two years (the red diamonds). Also plotted are the mean (shown by the blue dashed line) and the range (shown by the blue shaded region) of estimates of the longer-run equilibrium real rate, or r*, from several timeseries econometric models. The real federal funds rate has risen steadily since 2016, reflecting the Committee\\u2019s gradual removal of policy accommodation, and is now near the lower end of the range of r* estimates. Paragraph 3 of alternative C continues to note that \\u201cmonetary policy remains accommodative,\\u201d but if participants\\u2019 assessments of the current level of the neutral federal funds rate were toward the lower end of the range of estimates, this language, too, may need to be removed before too long. Yet the Committee may wish to limit the changes to the statement made at the same meeting to avoid giving the impression of a shift in the Committee\\u2019s policy intentions. For that reason, although alternative C removes the sentence on \\u201ccarefully monitor[ing] actual and expected inflation developments\\u201d from paragraph 4, it retains the reference to the symmetry of the inflation goal to avoid having the deletion interpreted as prematurely \\u201cdeclaring victory\\u201d on the inflation objective. In communicating the Committee\\u2019s outlook for the economy over the medium term, alternative C would be consistent with the message of your March SEP. Most of you submitted projections in which a period of modestly restrictive policy ultimately raises the unemployment rate to its longer-run normal rate and returns inflation to 2 percent from above. In a memo that we sent you ahead of the December 2016 meeting, we noted that such soft landings have not been achieved frequently, although they are not without precedent in the postwar record. If market participants expected a moderately restrictive policy along these lines, the yield curve could flatten further or even invert. As shown in the middle-left panel, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 3-month Treasury bill is low by historical standards, but not exceptionally low. In particular, this spread stands at about the 25th percentile of the distribution since 1990 and still about 1\\u00bd percentage points above the average historical level associated with the onset of recessions. The flattening of the yield curve over the past year comes up frequently in our conversations with market participants. Many saw the recent fiscal stimulus and attendant financing needs of the Treasury as important factors shaping the yield curve. As mentioned in the middle right panel, they offered two different narratives on how the fiscal developments might affect the economic outlook. Under the benign view, the addition of fiscal stimulus will require raising the federal funds rate above its longer-run level for a time, but not by enough to derail the expansion. The more pessimistic interpretation of the yield curve flattening is that it reflects concerns that the fiscal stimulus will create a fiscal cliff around 2020, when the effects of the current stimulus are expected to wane and thereby bring forward the end of the expansion. May 1\\u20132, 2018 103 of 185 While none of our contacts saw the flattening of the yield curve as signaling heightened recession risk over the next year, several of you commented at previous meetings on an important empirical regularity of the past five decades\\u2014namely, that a negative term spread has preceded every recession. The lower-left panel updates the results of two regressions that I presented in my briefing in December, and they are very much consistent with President Bullard\\u2019s comments. The first uses the spread between the 10-year and 3-month yield to compute the probability that the U.S. economy will be in recession at any time over the next four quarters. In a univariate model, as shown by the red line, the current level of the yield spread implies about a 35 percent probability of such an event, up from about 15 percent since you began raising the funds rate. But market commentary has questioned the reliability of the yield spread as an indicator of recession risk in light of continued low term premiums. An alternative approach is to combine the yield spread with other measures of financial conditions to assess the likelihood of a near-term recession. As I discussed in December, the \\u201cExcess Bond Premium\\u201d developed by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakraj\\u0161ek, shown in the lower-right panel, is a useful indicator because it tends to rise shortly before the onset of recessions as lenders demand increased compensation for bearing credit risk. As indicated by the green dashed line to the left, including both the yield spread and the excess bond premium in the regression model implies that the probability of a recession at any time in the next four quarters is only about 7 percent and is little changed over the past two years. This result suggests that further gradual removal of policy accommodation is not yet likely to jeopardize the expansion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That concludes my prepared remarks. The March statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 9 of the handout. I will be happy to take any questions. Vice Chair. Thomas, you said that the yield spread was in the 25th percentile if you take the data since 1990. Is that really a good time frame? Because you\\u2019re really giving a lot of weight to the post-crisis period when we were far away from full employment. And I wonder if it would be better to eliminate this cycle because this cycle is so unusual and take the period before 2007\\u2014just to get your thoughts on that. First of all, I don\\u2019t have the number with me. No, I know you don\\u2019t. I just think that it tends to bias down that estimate of where you are. May 1\\u20132, 2018 104 of 185 Looking at the exhibit\\u2014to just give another example\\u2014the horizontal line is the mean level at the onset of recessions. You see that, in the previous two recessions, that level was quite a bit higher. It\\u2019s very much driven by the early 1980s observations. Any of these statistics are somewhat sensitive to the sample period, and I\\u2019m not claiming that 1990 is necessarily the right time frame to look at. At the same time, I think it\\u2019s interesting to ask what the implications are of a potentially persistently lower term premium\\u2014the question that came up in Josh\\u2019s briefing. Even though it may come up, we don\\u2019t necessarily think that it is going to go up to where it was, say, in the 1980s. So it is difficult to say exactly what the most relevant sample is. By including those 10 years, roughly almost 40 percent of your sample is this cycle, and because the cycle isn\\u2019t even over yet and you\\u2019d expect the yield curve to be flatter toward the end of the cycle, I think you\\u2019re sort of biasing down your estimate a little bit. Thanks. President Rosengren. So a little bit on that theme, but from the opposite standpoint. When I think of a flatter yield curve, Europe, Japan, and the United States have all expanded their balance sheets very significantly and haven\\u2019t done that in previous periods. To some extent, it is a policy decision of the central banks around the world to try to depress rates in the long end of the market. And so when I think about the statistical relationship, we\\u2019ve made a choice that we were very gradual at the long end of the market in letting the balance sheet roll off and deciding to focus primarily on the short end. The consequence of that would be a flatter yield curve than we would presumably have seen if we had chosen a different exit strategy and if the Europeans and Japanese were at a very different stage as well. How do you think about a May 1\\u20132, 2018 105 of 185 statistical relationship that is really tied to where the long end of the market is when there\\u2019s so much intervention by central banks around the world? I would think that if you look at it narrowly, about the ability to predict recessions, I would argue in some sense you want to get the expectations for the path of the short-term interest rate, because the signal is when the market participants expect that you need to cut the rate. On average, they\\u2019re actually correct about that, right? And that is what\\u2019s sending the signal. We are still in the period in which the balance sheet here is very large and where balance sheets elsewhere are even still in expansion. It seems that that would mean that there\\u2019s potentially less policy space. But I\\u2019m not quite sure whether it would have a meaningful effect on the signal that you take from the slope of the expected path of the policy rate, because that arguably should really depend on whether you think the economy is nearing recession, when you need to change the policy rate path. Two-hander? John. Yes. I thought President Rosengren\\u2019s question was an excellent question. I asked my staff this question months ago\\u2014Thomas Mertens and, I think, Michael Bauer worked on this. It\\u2019s in an Economic Letter that we published. To get at this general question, they actually threw the term premium into a standard probit model for the probability of recession, separately from the slope of the yield curve. Does the term premium\\u2014and it could be because of QE or other reasons\\u2014affect this relationship? They also put in r* to see if the level of interest rates entered independently. Their findings are that the slope of the yield curve is an amazingly robust predictor of recessions, and including the term premium in the relationship did not change that result. It doesn\\u2019t prove overwhelmingly that the question about May 1\\u20132, 2018 106 of 185 QE is not a good one, but the evidence is that at least movements of the term premium separate from the inverted yield curve don\\u2019t seem to change this basic idea that the inverted yield curve comes before a recession historically in the United States. President Kaplan. I think I\\u2019m okay. On this bottom right-hand exhibit, I may read this paper just to dig into what credit spreads actually do right before a recession, because which comes first? My guess is people start to get nervous, and then credit spreads begin to change. In a funny way, the tighter the credit spreads are sometimes as good a predictor as recession as spreads that are gapping out, because I remember blow-by-blow what happened in 2008, and 2007 in particular, when we were starting to go sideways. My point\\u2014which is not worth making, we\\u2019re about to have a drink, which may be more important [laughter]\\u2014 is, I don\\u2019t take any comfort from the tightness of credit spreads right now, because I think they could change on a dime. You just need some data, and everything will look different. President Bullard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the discussion of this yield curve issue, and I think it is the right time to have this debate and talk about it. And I agree with President Williams about the San Francisco Economic Letter, which I would recommend. We did other versions of that same kind of analysis. We came to the same conclusion that the yield curve does a pretty good job of predicting recessions in the United States. If you go across countries, it\\u2019s going to break down, and I guess my thinking on that is that small, open economies are a different kettle of fish than big economies. So I think that\\u2019s why the crosscountry evidence doesn\\u2019t look as good, at least in my mind, right now. May 1\\u20132, 2018 107 of 185 There are a lot of recession-predictor-type models that are kind of univariate models. There are many competing models. It looks like the yield curve is probably the best one of those. You might be able to combine things. There\\u2019s a lot of literature on it. The theory behind it is a little bit sketchy, and it doesn\\u2019t always fit into our macro model. So when you talk to macro guys like me, we\\u2019ll say, \\u201cYield curve? What?\\u201d But I want to respect the empirical evidence, and I want the Committee and all of us to think about this and debate this and not go blindly into a yield curve inversion without saying, \\u201cOkay, we went in with our eyes open. We knew this could happen, but we think it\\u2019s a risk worth taking.\\u201d I think previous incarnations of this Committee have done that, but because they felt like they had an inflation problem they had to fight, they were weighing some risks about getting inflation under control versus the possibility that you would induce a recession, and it maybe went one way or the other for them. But for us, we don\\u2019t have that much of an inflation problem, so I put less weight on that than previous committees probably did. I guess is the bottom line is, I\\u2019d like to keep a positive slope to the yield curve. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. President Kashkari. Thank you. Very briefly, just one quick comment and then one question. The comment is, for me, the yield curve flattening is notable. I mean, we know in a tightening cycle it\\u2019s going to fall. But it\\u2019s flattening in a time of a big tax cut, a big increase in spending, and a roll-off of our balance sheet. That, to me, is some signal that we should take seriously and not just say, \\u201cWell, this time is different.\\u201d But then, Thomas, shifting gears for a second, on your chart on the top right on where is neutral, my question is where is the lower bound problem? Now, granted, the chart only starts in 2015. Maybe you\\u2019d have to go back further. But this suggests that the effective real federal May 1\\u20132, 2018 108 of 185 funds rate that we achieved was well below neutral. So I\\u2019m trying to understand what this is telling me. That\\u2019s right. By all the methods that I\\u2019m familiar with, a longer-run measure of the neutral federal funds rate never went as far into negative territory. The shorterrun measure is obtained using DSGE models that are much more volatile. But, for example, the Laubach\\u2013Williams measure, of course, always thought that there was, in fact, a negative real rate gap throughout the post-crisis period. Does that mean that there is no zero lower bound problem? Well, the r* estimate\\u2014at least, for example, in our model\\u2014is of course boosted by asset purchases. So it\\u2019s not like you didn\\u2019t need to resort to any other tool. You did need to have other tools in order to, in effect, boost r* to a level such that you were still able to provide the accommodation that the economy needed. So I would not view this as \\u201cThere is no zero lower bound problem.\\u201d Obviously, you need to resort to quite challenging tools. But is the right comparison the historical real federal funds rate, which you have here in black against your blue dashed line, or should it be against a short-run neutral rate? Are you comparing a short-run federal funds rate to a long-run neutral rate? And isn\\u2019t that apples and oranges? No. First, you shouldn\\u2019t identify the blue dashed line with the Laubach\\u2013Williams measure. The blue dashed line is, of course, the mean of the eight measures that are represented here. Any of these measures will tell you that this is measuring the amount of stimulus that you are currently imparting that, over time, is going to boost the output gap. If you resorted to a more short-run measure of r*, that would be telling you more an answer not to May 1\\u20132, 2018 109 of 185 how you stabilize the economy over time but what would you need to do in order to basically eliminate the output gap at a much higher frequency. Looking at 2015 on this chart\\u2014and President Kashkari mentioned this to me\\u2014your eye tells that, unless you think about the equilibrium real funds rate, there is a shocking amount of accommodation that was being supplied in 2015, and yet we didn\\u2019t have a lot of inflation. So I think the shorter-run measure is the one that tells you that you didn\\u2019t have as much accommodation. And, presumably, the equilibrium funds rate in real terms was probably negative, and this was accommodative, but not nearly as much. Now, you\\u2019re pointing us in this chart to 2019 and 2020, and now all of a sudden the real rate is going above r*. And I think we\\u2019re supposed to infer that there is some tightness involved there. We\\u2019re kind of mixing these concepts, in a way\\u2014it\\u2019s in the eye of the beholder as to what you\\u2019re trying to get out of this, and we\\u2019re one of the beholders. Just a different eye. It was an attempt to construct the chart artfully. The historical estimates end where they end, and, of course, that means that it\\u2019s not clear where, for example, these measures are going to move over that period. So how quickly you are moving from \\u201caccommodative\\u201d to \\u201cneutral\\u201d depends in part on what r* is going to do in the future. The eye seems to see that there isn\\u2019t a whole lot of upward movement going on. And if that was true, if you more or less extended one of these lines straight out, then you might say that by late 2019, it seems that you are at the midpoint of these estimates. But, again, there is no guarantee that these estimates are just going to go sideways. We don\\u2019t know that. But the context of the entire discussion is about gradual increases intended to remove accommodation and where we\\u2019re sort of tight. So that\\u2019s why I would focus it the way that I did. But it\\u2019s a subjective assessment, I think. May 1\\u20132, 2018 110 of 185 I completely agree. I think that looking at these statistical estimates is helpful. This is basically what the data tell you as of now, and, of course, it\\u2019s very difficult to make predictions. Thomas, just a question. The blue range here, is that the range of estimates, which is what the line says? Does that include confidence intervals? No. It\\u2019s purely the range of estimates. That\\u2019s the blend of estimates, and then, of course, each estimate has a confidence interval. That\\u2019s right. The footnote points you back to material in the previous round\\u2019s Tealbook in which we also show the confidence intervals around the individual estimates. I just wanted to make sure I understood. Absolutely. Or, as I like to call it, I have not that much \\u201cconfidence interval\\u201d. All right. Thank you. If I can just keep you for one minute before we go down to the West Court Caf\\u00e9. I have something I would like to mention, and I think it would go particularly well with that drink that President Kaplan mentioned. And that is, as I\\u2019ve mentioned to some of you, I am looking for some ways to tinker at the margins with the format of the FOMC meetings, and I want to say right up front that I don\\u2019t think that our meetings fail to serve their purpose. I think they serve it very well. I don\\u2019t think that we produce bad results or that we fail to allow diverse views or anything like that. The overall idea is more to make changes to the format so that they become maybe, at the margin, less formal, less scripted, more interactive\\u2014particularly between participants\\u2014less May 1\\u20132, 2018 111 of 185 repetitive, and more focused on the issues of the day. I think back to various examples over the years in which a conversation breaks out, and I would point to the previous meeting at which President Rosengren brought up the question of the relationship between SEP forecasts and the staff forecast, and we had a nice go-round exchange. The idea would be to try to set conditions or have things on the agenda that would somehow provoke more of that at the margin. That\\u2019s the idea. I just want to say\\u2014I don\\u2019t want to talk about individual ideas right now, but I welcome ideas. It\\u2019s going to be, of course, a consultative process. Please call. Please write. I hope we can find some changes, and we\\u2019ll obviously develop some sort of a process for collecting ideas and talking, but I just wanted to get people thinking about that, and we\\u2019ll work on it together as we go forward. And with that, we go to the West Court Caf\\u00e9. Thanks, everyone. [Meeting recessed] May 1\\u20132, 2018 112 of 185 May 2 Session Good morning, everyone. Before we get started, some news: The President is visiting the State Department at noon. And what that means is, for those of you who desire to leave the premises between 11:00 and 1:00\\u2014 We\\u2019re trapped! \\u2014there may be delays of 15 minutes at the most. They\\u2019re not going to shut the place down for two hours, but just know that if you\\u2019re planning to catch, for example, an 11:30 flight, don\\u2019t try to leave at 11:00. [Laughter] This will be between 11:00 and 1:00. So that\\u2019s just a risk. With that said, let\\u2019s resume now and begin our monetary policy go-round with President Rosengren. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I support alternative B as written. While we are not taking any action today, consistent with limited changes in the statement, the market seems well aligned with an increase in June, and I think that is quite appropriate. I am concerned, however, that the markets are unduly optimistic about the future path of rates. With the Tealbook forecasting inflation at our target for this year and an unemployment rate below what is viewed as sustainable by this Committee, it is becoming more difficult to explain why we would not move the funds rate up more steadily than is implied by the median of the SEP. The median funds rate path in the SEP implies a pause in our tightening at some point during this year, but I think the macro environment is more consistent with at least three more tightenings this year, not two. The concern is that a slower pace of normalization now risks being forced into a steeper path in the future once pressure due to a tightening labor market shows through to nominal wage growth and price inflation or, alternatively, financial instability. May 1\\u20132, 2018 113 of 185 Such an acceleration in the pace of policy tightening, especially if the markets have not been prepared adequately for such a change, risks sharp reversals in investor behavior that could introduce heightened volatility into financial markets. Such disruptions have the potential to lead to an episode of financial instability. That logic, of course, presumes that we are sticking to a framework that maintains a 2 percent inflation target and a so-called balanced approach, and all of my remarks to this point have held to that assumption. In previous years, our challenge was to attain our 2 percent inflation goal, an accomplishment that was by no means certain a couple of years ago. It would have been premature at that point to consider strategies that might move inflation more persistently above 2 percent. But now that we are finally achieving a 2 percent inflation, we should be planning for a broader discussion of the framework. If we were, perhaps opportunistically, willing to allow the actual and target inflation rates to rise above 2 percent, I would be much less concerned with the pace of tightening currently envisioned in the SEP. However, under the current framework, undue patience now is likely to build significant macroeconomic imbalances. One way or another, whether through an episode of financial instability or by requiring a more aggressive and thus risky policy response, such imbalances are not likely to end well. They never have historically. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Mester. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I can support alternative B today and the statement as written, with the amendment discussed yesterday. As I discussed yesterday, I think the medium-run outlook supports continued gradual removal of accommodation. It seems the best strategy to balance the risks to both our policy goals and to avoid a buildup of financial stability risk. But because the public is not expecting May 1\\u20132, 2018 114 of 185 the Committee to act today and the Committee\\u2019s communications haven\\u2019t prepared the public for another increase, I can support no change in rates today. If the economy continues to perform as expected between now and our June meeting and there\\u2019s no material deterioration in the medium-run outlook, I will favor an increase in the funds rate in June. The wording of alternative B does not seem to change expectations of a June increase, so I\\u2019m supportive of it. I have a couple of comments, though. In paragraph 1, I have a slight preference for the simplified language on inflation expectations that appears in paragraph 1 of alternative C. In paragraph 2, I appreciate the change that eliminates the phrase saying that inflation will stabilize around our inflation goal. As I indicated in our previous meeting, the word \\u201cstabilize\\u201d ran the danger of suggesting less month-to-month variation in inflation numbers than is typical of that we recently experienced. Also in paragraph 2, I appreciate indicating that the \\u201crisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced\\u201d and removing the reference to the Committee \\u201cmonitoring inflation developments closely.\\u201d But with the removal in paragraph 2, I would also suggest that we remove the language from paragraph 4. Now, at some point, it would be useful for the Committee to reconsider the statement more fundamentally as part of its ongoing work to improve its communication. In the meantime, should we decide to raise the funds rate in June, it would be an opportune time to \\u201cclean up\\u201d some of the language we\\u2019ve been carrying in the course of several statements. And we\\u2019ve been asked to comment on alternative C as one way to do that. In considering those changes, I took a step back and thought about the current format of the statement. Now, I realize not everyone may view the statement the way I do, but I view it as having four paragraphs, with paragraphs 1 and 2 covering the economy and paragraphs 3 and 4 covering monetary policy. Within each topic, there\\u2019s a time element to the paragraphs. May 1\\u20132, 2018 115 of 185 Paragraph 1 discusses recent economic developments. Paragraph 2 discusses the outlook and risks around the outlook, conditional on appropriate monetary policy. Paragraph 3 discusses current monetary policy. And paragraph 4 discusses future policy considerations and gives a sense of the Committee\\u2019s reaction function. It conveys an important idea that policy is being set in a systematic way, something that can enhance Committee credibility by making decisions easier for the public to understand and anticipate. \\u201cSystematic policymaking\\u201d is something that the Committee needs to continue to convey through word and deed. With that as a guide, I would change the conditioning statement in paragraph 2 to merely say \\u201cconditional on appropriate policy, the Committee\\u2019s outlook is X, Y, and Z.\\u201d I would put the Committee\\u2019s view of what that appropriate policy rate path is\\u2014that is, further gradual increases\\u2014into paragraph 4. Whether paragraph 4 gives more explicit forward guidance or whether it gives only information about how the Committee is approaching its future policy decisions\\u2014that is, information about the reaction function\\u2014will vary with economic circumstances. In current circumstances, I believe it\\u2019s appropriate to continue to indicate the Committee anticipates further increases in the funds rate, because this will help align the public\\u2019s expectations with this expected policy rate path. As I indicated in the previous meeting, I do agree it\\u2019s time to delete the language that says the Committee expects the funds rate to remain below its longer-run level for some time. This is problematic language in view of the path shown in the SEP, and I\\u2019d even be comfortable removing that language at this meeting. Finally, with respect to how we discuss our monetary policy goals in paragraph 4, those who were around when the longer-run goals and strategy document was negotiated in 2011 and 2012 and first adopted by the Committee in 2012 may remember the discussions of the tension May 1\\u20132, 2018 116 of 185 between the two parts of our mandate\\u2014namely, why the Committee should set a numerical goal for inflation but not for the maximum-employment part of the mandate. The proposed language in paragraph 4 in alternative C calls attention to that tension by using \\u201cobjective\\u201d for maximum employment and \\u201cgoal\\u201d for inflation. I don\\u2019t feel calling attention to that distinction is helpful. I prefer we keep the alternative B language that refers to both as objectives. After all, we use the term \\u201cobjective\\u201d in paragraph 2 when speaking about 2 percent inflation, so I don\\u2019t see why we wouldn\\u2019t do the same in paragraph 4. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Governor Quarles. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\u2019ll be brief. I support alternative B as written and as amended. I continue to believe that a policy of gradual tightening is most consistent with meeting both objectives of our dual mandate. Inflation is effectively at our target, with still-moderate nominal wage growth and not much sign of further pressure on inflation. We can be patient. That said, the upward path of rates is likely needed to keep the economy growing at a sustainable rate. Let me just add, there was a fair bit of discussion yesterday about the flattening of the yield curve\\u2014certainly something that we should continue to monitor. That said, I don\\u2019t think the flattening that we\\u2019ve experienced up to this point is either particularly surprising or troubling. I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if the yield curve would flatten a bit more. The curve isn\\u2019t that much flatter today\\u2014maybe 10 basis points\\u2014than it was at the end of last year. We all remember that in December, the staff presented analysis that showed that the slope of the curve had shifted much more abruptly during past tightening cycles relative to the current cycle. What we\\u2019ve seen isn\\u2019t terribly unexpected. May 1\\u20132, 2018 117 of 185 I thought President Williams and President Bullard made very interesting points about the nonetheless almost invariable corollaries of an inverted yield curve, whatever one might think about causation. But I still think you have to have some sort of view as to what\\u2019s causing the flattening of the yield curve to come to that view. If my skin is unusually warm, it may be because I\\u2019m ill, or I could just have been sitting outside by the pool for an hour, and I need to know which it is before running to the doctor. Thinking ahead to our next meeting, I appreciated the discussion of alternative C as a possible template for the June statement. As was widely discussed in previous meetings, some of the forward-guidance language in paragraph 4 has grown stale. It should be removed at the earliest opportunity at which it can be explained. And one benefit of taking it out is that it keeps our powder dry should we have to put it back in. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Bostic. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support the decision to maintain the current target of the federal funds rate at this meeting and the language in alternative B. Both the economy and inflation are performing at or slightly beyond target, and I take that as a signal that we should have a neutral policy stance. Because our current position remains accommodating, I believe that further rate increases are in order. As for the pace of these increases, for well over a year, this body has communicated that the move of monetary policy away from full stimulus would be gradual. It is important that we continue on this path. And because we raised the target range for the funds rate last time, we should stand pat today. I think pauses are appropriate in the absence of evidence of overheating in the economy. My contacts tell me that there has been great value to their businesses and our economy in having a clear, consistent policy here at the Federal Reserve that is implemented as May 1\\u20132, 2018 118 of 185 expected. Some people expect the FOMC to deliver what it promises, and we should not surprise or disappoint them. Regarding the statement, I\\u2019m especially pleased that paragraph 2 of both the alternative B and alternative C statements more clearly casts the Committee\\u2019s policy actions in the context of a symmetric view about inflation. My own forecast projects that even with further gradual tightening of monetary policy, inflation is likely to run a bit above 2 percent in the near term. In my judgment, such an outcome is not a problem that would, in and of itself, necessitate a more aggressive response. Rather, it is a feature of a well-calibrated policy that supports both strong labor market conditions and our longer-run symmetric inflation goal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Kaplan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I support alternative B as written. Given my forecasts of real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation, I believe it\\u2019s appropriate for us to continue to remove accommodation in a gradual and patient manner. Three increases over 2018\\u2014that is, two more\\u2014are still my base case, although I am open minded about a fourth increase. But I\\u2019d like to make that judgment later this year. As we go through this process this year, I will be carefully monitoring the 10-year Treasury rate and the shape of the yield curve. It\\u2019s my own view that the reason for the flatness of the curve has a lot to do with the sluggish outlook for real GDP growth in the medium term. Put another way, I believe the next two or three moves\\u2014particularly three, once we get to 2\\u00bc to 2\\u00bd\\u2014are likely manageable. But from there, I think the judgments will be much tougher, and the risk of a Fed overshoot becomes much more of an issue, at least for me. In that regard, I think we should be data dependent and not predetermined or rigid in our plans. May 1\\u20132, 2018 119 of 185 Also, as we move forward in the year, I think we would be well served, as soon as we could, to have press conferences after every meeting. Not only will this help improve the clarity of our communications, which I think will get much more important once we get to that 2\\u00bc to 2\\u00bd percent level but it will also give this Committee more operating flexibility, which I think we\\u2019ll be glad we have when the time comes. In terms of the statement language, I\\u2019ll just make a couple of comments on alternative C. I would agree with President Mester on not changing the first two sentences in paragraph 4. I like the changes that she proposed here in staying with the previous language. And, as you\\u2019ve heard me mention before, on the deleted language at the bottom, I would retain the sentence about \\u201cthe Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases.\\u201d I know it\\u2019s redundant to some extent with paragraph 2, but I think it would be useful, at the risk of being redundant, to make clear to the market and to observers what the Fed\\u2019s thinking is on our reaction function. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Barkin. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I\\u2019m comfortable supporting alternative B today. The data over the past several months have been, by and large, consistent with the path we\\u2019ve articulated, and I see no reason to vary from that path. Two sentences in alternative B are, I think, ready to be revisited. At the end of paragraph 1, we continue to state that \\u201cmarket-based measures of inflation compensation remain low.\\u201d I\\u2019m aware of the history of this language and its intent when it was introduced\\u2014to underscore our concern with the soft inflation readings we were seeing then. And we retained this language early last year when inflation compensation numbers got close to where they are now to support the view there were still downside risks to inflation. But today, as I look at the language with May 1\\u20132, 2018 120 of 185 fresh eyes\\u2014and with my expectation that we\\u2019re experiencing a more sustained return of inflation to target\\u2014the language appears to me to be less useful and potentially misleading, as it appears to call out downside risks to inflation when, in the next paragraph, we characterize risks as balanced. The other element of the statement that is ripe for removal is the end of paragraph 4, the statement that the federal funds rate is \\u201clikely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. As I said at our previous meeting, when it gets removed from alternative A and alternative C for conflicting reasons, one might want to consider whether including it could actually be confusing. These two changes are both substantive and open to misinterpretation, so I think it makes sense to execute them in June when the Chair has an opportunity to discuss them in a press conference. I note that the staff is unsurprisingly ahead of me on both changes. Alternative C incorporates both of these and, I think, does so quite well. Finally, a request for our next meeting\\u2014I would love to ask the staff to run, perhaps as an alternative scenario, the Tealbook forecast with a more moderate path of rate increases, maybe similar to the March SEP median. I think that forecast would make us take on in a more direct way the gap between the Tealbook sense of the strength of the economy and ours. And speaking for myself, I think that would be a valuable challenge to my thinking before we take on our next rate decision. Thank you. President Evans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B today. Now that we have better confirmation in the data, I\\u2019m more confident that we are headed toward our symmetric 2 percent inflation target. However, low inflation expectations remain a concern, so I May 1\\u20132, 2018 121 of 185 think we need to keep the pace of tightening gradual to help bolster expectations. The data will determine whether this means two or three additional rate hikes this year. I guess that means data dependence. Markets seem comfortable with this range of funds rate outcomes and our data-dependent approach. And, as I discussed last time, given our current best thinking on the nature of the inflation process\\u2014that is, the non-accelerationist Phillips curve\\u2014there\\u2019s no reason to think we need to push rates beyond what markets expect. Once inflation expectations measures are stable around 2 percent, simply bringing policy rates to neutral or perhaps a little above should be enough to stabilize inflation at our target. I\\u2019d like to spend the rest of my time discussing the suitability of alternative C for our future policy statement. My bottom line is that I think it will serve us well for the near term, but there will be some further communications challenges that we will need to address, perhaps in the not-too-distant future. First, I\\u2019m glad the alternative continues to describe our expected funds rate path as gradual increases in the target range. As I just noted, I think gradualism is necessary to bring inflation expectations into better alignment with our symmetric 2 percent objective. Continuing to communicate a gradual pace also conveys to the public that, though the Committee is in data-dependent mode, we are unlikely to shift gears abruptly. This should help keep the market\\u2019s policy expectations from overreacting to the ups and downs we inevitably will see in the coming data. Second, the language in paragraph 2 is artful in saying that future \\u201cincreases . . . will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity and employment.\\u201d \\u201cSustained\\u201d is the key term to parse here. Presumably, sustainable growth means growth that could be repeated year after year. For activity, that means 1\\u00be to 2 percent, our views for long-run growth in the SEP. For employment, there\\u2019s a wide range of estimates\\u2014say, 60,000 to 120,000 per month. May 1\\u20132, 2018 122 of 185 Under this interpretation of \\u201csustained,\\u201d alternative C associates our tightening path with GDP and employment growth moderating to such lower numbers. This is largely in line with the projections for 2020 in the March SEP. However, as we think output will be above potential and unemployment below its natural rate, at some point the SEPs will show real GDP growth falling below trend and the unemployment rate rising modestly as we attempt to engineer the quintessential soft landing. Currently, this slowdown lies beyond our 2020 forecast horizon. But I can imagine these lower projections emerging in September when we roll the SEP forward to forecast 2021. I can\\u2019t really improve on the alternative C offering at this time. I just think that our attempts to speak plainly will become more difficult as the forecast horizon moves forward. And if inflation pressures remain contained, then describing the rationale for below-trend output growth and rising unemployment may be even more challenging. The statement in paragraph 3 of alternative C that \\u201cmonetary policy remains accommodative\\u201d may also have a short shelf life. Within a year of gradual increases, the funds rate could be in the range of 2\\u00bd to 2\\u00be percent\\u2014and I agree with the comments that President Kaplan made about how, once we get to this juncture, I think it\\u2019s going to be more challenging\\u2014 thus reaching the SEP central tendency for the long-run neutral rate. And if the short-run equilibrium federal funds rate continues to be below the longer-term rate, then we\\u2019ll be at neutral even sooner. Indeed, savvy Fed watchers already wonder where we see the current funds rate vis-\\u00e0-vis short-run r*. We talked about that briefly yesterday with Thomas Laubach. I think it could soon be helpful to include a modifier in front of \\u201caccommodative\\u201d\\u2014 something like \\u201cmonetary policy remains modestly accommodative.\\u201d This would have the virtue of letting the public know that we are reasonably close to a natural resting point for policy, or it May 1\\u20132, 2018 123 of 185 could be the first step in preparing them if we eventually need to move beyond neutral to a restrictive stance. Naturally, when we think we are roughly at neutral, we should remove the reference to being accommodative altogether. Of course, the hard part is figuring out where neutral is. We\\u2019ll probably find ourselves turning to current growth and inflation developments as a guide\\u2014the somewhat uncomfortable but inevitable \\u201cwe\\u2019ll know it when we see it\\u201d mode for calibrating policy. You know, I had not really taken great note of paragraph 4 language about our maximum-employment objective and our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal in alternative C, and I appreciate that being mentioned. I think that I don\\u2019t have a strong opinion about \\u201cobjective\\u201d versus \\u201cgoal,\\u201d but I do think it\\u2019s extremely useful that we insert the term \\u201csymmetric 2 percent inflation goal.\\u201d And it could be that by trying to get \\u201csymmetric\\u201d in there, we end up with this \\u201cobjective\\u201d and \\u201cgoal.\\u201d I don\\u2019t have a strong opinion on or preference for that, except for the fact that I think \\u201csymmetric\\u201d is quite useful. So, in sum, if it\\u2019s appropriate to increase the funds rate in June, I would support using the language in alternative C. But we should think ahead a bit more about how we describe appropriate policy as we switch from supporting improving labor markets and rising inflation to engineering a soft landing to our policy objectives. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. President Harker. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I support alternative B at this meeting, as amended. Policy remains accommodative, and, as I alluded to yesterday, I\\u2019m more confident that inflation will rise to or above our target and that economic growth will be sustained. With firmer evidence of strengthening in inflation, I\\u2019m becoming more confident that a policy that raises the funds rate four times this year may be appropriate, depending on how the data evolve. May 1\\u20132, 2018 124 of 185 That does not imply that we should be overly concerned with inflation rates rising modestly above 2 percent. The target is symmetric, and we should miss on the upside as often as we miss on the downside. And I concur with President Evans that the addition of that word is appropriate. There\\u2019s also a good deal of uncertainty regarding the natural rate of interest, and that implies significant uncertainty over the level of the neutral funds rate. We may be only 100 basis points or so from neutral. If that\\u2019s the case, it implies that we should proceed cautiously and gradually with the removal of accommodation. I anticipate that output will grow at about its trend rate and inflation will only slightly exceed 2 percent, which leads me to conclude that any significant overshooting of our policy rate would be problematic for the economy. Uncertainty also appears to be abnormally high, and the increased uncertainty is being reflected, for example, in greater asset market volatility. Many of my contacts are concerned with the possibility of a trade war. And even if one does not occur, a further increase in uncertainty could damp the entire economic climate. Therefore, I think we should remain prudent and not remove accommodation at anything but a gradual pace. Regarding the language in alternative C, I think the paragraph 2 language gives a clear assessment of how we operate. It indicates that our policy rate path is intended to be consistent with our dual mandate, and consistency will likely require some gradual increase in the funds rate. Paragraph 4 continues to indicate the pace of those increases will be governed by economic outcomes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President George. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, too, support alternative B. Maintaining the funds rate at its current level is consistent with the Committee\\u2019s strategy for a gradual path of May 1\\u20132, 2018 125 of 185 normalization. Looking ahead to the June meeting, however, I do support further adjustments in the stance of policy, assuming no change in the outlook. I also support a recalibration of the statement at the June meeting to more clearly express the Committee\\u2019s expectations. While I consider the risks to the outlook roughly balanced in the near term, I see considerable uncertainties over the medium term. In particular, with unemployment below most estimates of its longer-term level, with real GDP expected to grow faster than the potential rate, and with inflation headed higher, I see a nonnegligible risk that inflation could rise uncomfortably above our target. On the other hand, rising longer-term interest rates, declining equity values, the possibility of a yield curve inversion, and uncertainty about trade policy all present downside risks over the medium term. In this context, I would prefer we deemphasize forward guidance in our communication and associate a sense of greater uncertainty and data dependence with our policy rate path. In particular, I support dropping the guidance that says \\u201cthe federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run\\u201d as proposed in alternative C. In addition, I think we need to reevaluate whether we still want to describe our interest rate normalization path as gradual. While my baseline outlook does not call for speeding up on the path to normalization, I\\u2019m concerned that our current forward guidance has a familiar ring to that of 2003. We said we would keep rates low because inflation was low and financial imbalances were thought to be benign. In my view, this guidance gave a false sense of stability, which in turn led to greater risk-taking and facilitated a buildup of financial imbalances that ended poorly. Of course, it is also possible that the downside risks I mentioned earlier could materialize, in which case we might want to slow the pace of normalization. The point is that the May 1\\u20132, 2018 126 of 185 uncertainty around the medium-term outlook makes it difficult to provide forward guidance, and I would prefer we deemphasize it in the statement in June. Finally, on the basis of the discussion yesterday about the effective federal funds rate relative to IOER, I support resuming work about the long-run operating framework. Knowing where we\\u2019re headed in terms of the size of the balance sheet and the related operating framework would help us make tactical decisions about how we, from an operational standpoint, can best achieve our objectives for interest rate control. Thank you. Thank you. President Bullard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\u2019m going to give some comments here that try to react to what other people have been saying around the table. I\\u2019m going to start off with core PCE inflation versus the Dallas Fed trimmed mean rate as a measure of underlying inflation for use by the Committee. This is a topic that I\\u2019ve tried to hit on in the past. I think it is time to consider our putting more emphasis on the Dallas Fed trimmed mean as our main measure of underlying inflation. Several of you pointed out yesterday that the Dallas Fed trimmed mean was 1.8 percent a year ago and is 1.8 percent today. So that would indicate not too much in the way of developments in terms of underlying inflation. Since 2011, the Dallas Fed trimmed mean tracks core PCE inflation quite closely except for two incidents, which I think hurt the Committee. One was in 2015, and the other was in 2017. In both of those cases, there were special factors that came in and moved core PCE inflation lower. And then in both cases, we spent an entire year saying, \\u201cWell, core inflation is lower, but it\\u2019s not really lower because there are special factors, and therefore we\\u2019re going to wait until the special factors roll out.\\u201d But if you look at the Dallas Fed trimmed mean in both of May 1\\u20132, 2018 127 of 185 those cases, it did not drop, and you would not have had to tell those stories. You would have been able to say, \\u201cWell, inflation is pretty flat,\\u201d and that\\u2019s what we were trying to say anyway. Another element of this is that the Dallas Fed trimmed mean was about 1.6 percent during 2015. It\\u2019s now about 1.8 percent. I think that gives you a better sense of what\\u2019s happened over the past several years. In terms of inflation, there was almost no movement but very gradual movement up toward 2 percent. I think that\\u2019s a better assessment of what\\u2019s happening. Now we\\u2019ve got core PCE, and markets are saying, \\u201cWell, core PCE was 1.3 percent in the middle of last year\\u2014now it\\u2019s up at 1.9 percent. There must be increasing inflation pressure in the economy.\\u201d I think that\\u2019s a deceptive signal, and that\\u2019s coming from artificial factors in core PCE inflation that aren\\u2019t in the Dallas Fed trimmed mean. So it\\u2019s feeding into an accelerating inflation story that I\\u2019m not sure is really there. Why do we have to do this? Why do we have to stick with core PCE inflation? I\\u2019m not quite sure. We have a better measure. Let\\u2019s use it. I think the fact that we use core PCE inflation is harming our own perceptions of what\\u2019s going on with underlying inflation, and it harms our communications. I know a lot of you have cited the Dallas Fed trimmed mean. It has been a trend over the past five years or more, and I\\u2019d encourage everyone to go more in that direction. I think it\\u2019s a better measure. Let me turn to some ideas about the statement. I do support alternative B for today and, actually, for quite a while into the future. [Laughter] I think we may want to think about something like alternative A for next time, so let me try to make the case for alternative A. In my opinion, as I said yesterday, inflation expectations are still too low for comfort for this Committee. It\\u2019s true that something like the five-year TIPS-based measure of expected inflation\\u2014or compensation, really, but let\\u2019s call that expected inflation\\u2014is about 2 percent, but May 1\\u20132, 2018 128 of 185 then you have to convert that into an expectation for PCE inflation that\\u2019s based on market factors. If you make that conversion\\u2014and even if you don\\u2019t put in risk premiums or anything like that\\u2014you\\u2019re going to get a number like 1\\u00be percent for market-based expected inflation over the next five years. The market is saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t really think you\\u2019re going to hit your inflation target over the next five years.\\u201d Now, you might say, \\u201cWell, this is close enough for government work.\\u201d But, you know, we have missed this for a long time, since early 2012. And the other thing about the marketbased measures is, they\\u2019re factoring everything in. They\\u2019re factoring in an economy that\\u2019s doing very well. They\\u2019re factoring in a strong labor market. They\\u2019re factoring in fiscal policy. They\\u2019re also factoring in oil prices. So it\\u2019s a sufficient statistic, and the kicker is that markets are factoring in a more \\u201cdovish\\u201d Committee than what this Committee is saying that we\\u2019re going to do on our baseline path. They\\u2019re anticipating that we\\u2019re going to have to back off somewhat from our interest rate increase path. And even doing that, we\\u2019re not going to hit our inflation target. That\\u2019s how I would interpret the market signal at this point. Just to put a little bit of emphasis on this, if you dig far enough in the Tealbook and look at the models we use to get an estimate of the probability of inflation exceeding 3 percent versus the probability of inflation being less than 1 percent, according to the models we use, we\\u2019ve still got a higher probability that inflation would be lower than 1 percent in the future rather than higher than 3 percent in the future. Those are tail events, but I think that\\u2019s interesting that, according to those models, the probabilities really haven\\u2019t shifted as much as the rhetoric has shifted around the table here. Inflation expectations are too low, and I think a good strategy for the Committee would be to use the fact that the economy is performing well\\u2014it doesn\\u2019t really get any better than this May 1\\u20132, 2018 129 of 185 from a central banker\\u2019s perspective\\u2014and try to get inflation expectations back to a reasonable level: I think 2\\u00bc or 2.3 percent on the five-year TIPS and maybe 2\\u00bd percent or higher on the five-year, five-year-forward, because those are CPI-based measures, and they have risk premiums and so on\\u2014other things in there. So I think that you\\u2019d like them to run somewhat higher than they are today, and that that would be a beautiful thing to do, because that would set us up for hitting our 2 percent target over the next five years, as opposed to again struggling on the low side over that period. Okay. A third topic I just wanted to touch on is to think about an alternative approach to the baseline Tealbook policy. I do think, as I\\u2019ve said before at this meeting, that the Taylor (1999) rule may have outlived its usefulness as a baseline policy measure, and maybe we should think about a different way to do this. I do understand that this is a difficult thing from the staff\\u2019s perspective\\u2014what do you want to present to the Committee?\\u2014but I think it\\u2019s gotten quite a ways out of alignment with what the Committee is thinking and with what markets are thinking. That\\u2019s okay. But I think we want to revisit this issue and think about what we\\u2019re doing. I agree with President Barkin\\u2019s comment on this. Let me just put out a possible question for consideration. We could ask the question differently than we do. Instead of assuming Taylor (1999), we could say, \\u201cWhat changes to the staff model would be necessary to rationalize the median SEP path of the policy rate?\\u201d And I think what would happen is, you\\u2019d say, \\u201cWell, this elasticity would have to be different. I\\u2019d have to change that coefficient.\\u201d Then you could come back and say, \\u201cHow reasonable are these modifications? Why don\\u2019t we want to make these modifications?\\u201d There are good reasons: They don\\u2019t fit the data, they\\u2019re unreasonable, or they\\u2019re crazy or something. And that would be a May 1\\u20132, 2018 130 of 185 way that we could then debate the median SEP path versus what the staff model says. How reasonable would those changes be? So that\\u2019s just one idea about maybe how to proceed here. I have just a few reactions to some of the things said this morning. President Rosengren said too much patience might create a situation in which we have to raise the policy rate aggressively later, and then that event might cause market volatility\\u2014it might cause a problem, might cause a recession. That\\u2019s a common argument made around this table. I do not agree with that argument. You know, that\\u2019s saying that we don\\u2019t want to be too patient today because we might make a mistake later. And I think that\\u2019s not the way to think about it. The way to think about it is, we\\u2019re going to be at exactly the right policy today and exactly the right policy later, and we\\u2019re going to prepare markets in exactly the right way so there wouldn\\u2019t be this jarring surprise in the future that would cause a recession. I think if it\\u2019s appropriate to be patient today, we should be. We could reset inflation expectations. And we have to have confidence in ourselves that if the data tell us to adjust, then we\\u2019re going to adjust and go from there. Governor Quarles asked a great question on the yield curve issue. He correctly says, not that much is really going on, as far as the flattening of the yield curve\\u2014that\\u2019s very common as an expansion goes along, and I totally agree with that, and I think the yield curve is fine where it is today. The question is, where are we going to be at the end of this year or early 2019? And if it does invert, what kind of signal is that sending? I think it is sending some kind of signal, and it does have some theoretical support because the long-term interest rate is supposed to be the sequence of future expected short-term rates. So markets are saying that future short-term rates will have to be lower. That sounds like at least a growth slowdown or maybe recession. So that\\u2019s why it seems to work pretty well in the U.S. data historically. May 1\\u20132, 2018 131 of 185 President Kaplan commented on press conferences. Of course, I\\u2019ve been a big advocate of going to regular press conferences. I agree with his assessment that they\\u2019re going to be more important as we go forward, and I\\u2019d like to get on with it if we can. I think the ability for the Chair to communicate on a regular basis, even if not too much is going on, is very reassuring to markets so that they understand that we\\u2019re not changing our plans more than what the data suggest. I would very much think that we want to get to that situation soon so that we can handle the variability in the data more effectively. President Barkin also called current inflation expectations acceptable. I think they\\u2019re too low, according to my calculations that translate market-based expectations into the PCE version. President Evans emphasized ideas about data dependence. I do think that we\\u2019re getting too mechanical here. I think markets are starting to think, with increased entrenchment, that we\\u2019re going to simply raise the policy rate every quarter come hell or high water and we\\u2019re going to look through all variation in the data and not change. I think we should at least have a contingency plan about what we would do and under what circumstances we would pause. I also agree with President Evans about the \\u201cremains accommodative\\u201d phrase in alternative C getting questionable. I think we need a modifier there. I would suggest \\u201csomewhat accommodative.\\u201d I think President Evans suggested something else. I think we have to do something to modify that particular term in alternative C. Okay. I\\u2019ll quit rambling on, and I appreciate the time, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Kashkari. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B. I continue to focus on three key indicators\\u2014core PCE inflation, inflation expectations, and indicators of labor market slack. I do take signal from core PCE inflation moving up. I think the fact that it\\u2019s May 1\\u20132, 2018 132 of 185 moving up slowly, with wage growth moving up slowly, is probably real and is reflecting economic reality. So I take comfort from that. But, as I said yesterday, I do also think that there is likely still some slack in the labor market. My policy views have changed in the sense that I\\u2019ve been calling for accommodative monetary policy. I feel more comfortable moving to a neutral stance in the near term, but the big question is, where is neutral? And I don\\u2019t see any evidence, in the data we\\u2019ve talked about today, that we should be going to a contractionary policy stance. I think the neutral stance makes more sense. But \\u201cwhere is neutral?\\u201d is a very big question mark, at least in my mind. There are lots of different models. The previous Tealbook\\u2014not this one, the March one\\u2014went through an update of different ranges, and the ranges for r* are all over the place. Returning to the discussion, Thomas, we had yesterday, when I think about it, I think about a short-term r* and a long-term r* in the short run and in the long run. In a sense, I think about a \\u201cyield curve*\\u201d\\u2014which gets kind of confusing. But if I think about where the 10-year rate is today, at 3 percent, minus 2 percent inflation, you have a real interest rate of 1 percent. The 10-year rate might be at its neutral value already. I don\\u2019t know. But my staff and I are going to do a lot more work trying to assess where neutral is. Then when I think about the yield curve, it\\u2019s not simply the inversion as a recession indicator. I look at the yield curve as giving us feedback on where neutral is. If we proceed down a path of continuing to raise short-term rates this year and if the 10-year rate were to stay at around 3 percent, yes, we would be approaching a flat or an inverted yield curve. But I think the market would be telling us, \\u201cHey, you\\u2019re pretty close to neutral already.\\u201d So I think we should take that seriously and take that into account. May 1\\u20132, 2018 133 of 185 When I look at alternative C, I have three quick comments. One comment is, in alternative A, there\\u2019s language that we expect to overshoot our inflation target. I actually like that language because I think most people around the table do expect us to overshoot the inflation target. And signaling that we\\u2019re expecting it and we\\u2019re comfortable with it would be helpful so markets don\\u2019t think that we\\u2019re going to overreact. So I would encourage us to consider the language in alternative A rather than what\\u2019s in alternative C in June. Second, I would caution us about baking in too many rate hikes this year, because if the yield curve does flatten, I think a number of us around the table would encourage us to pause. We don\\u2019t want to overcommit to a steep rate path that we may then have to back off from. I\\u2019d ask us to consider that. Then the last point is, I always struggle with this notion that we\\u2019re raising rates to sustain the expansion. I know what we\\u2019re trying to say, but I find this language intellectually contorted\\u2014like arguing that we need to cut taxes to balance the budget. We seem to be contorting ourselves to make this argument. I think a stronger argument is simply to say, \\u201cWe think we need to raise the federal funds rate in order to achieve our dual-mandate goals over the medium term.\\u201d And that gets us away from people getting concerned that we\\u2019re trying to raise the unemployment rate. If we\\u2019re trying to achieve our dual-mandate goals, we\\u2019re trying to achieve maximum employment, and we\\u2019re trying to achieve stable prices\\u2014without having to go to this intellectual contortion of raising rates to sustain the expansion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Governor Brainard. Thank you. The current economic outlook remains consistent with continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate. A gradual pace is still appropriate for two reasons. First, I expect the short-run level of the equilibrium federal funds rate also to rise only May 1\\u20132, 2018 134 of 185 gradually. I view the economy as moving from a long period of stubborn headwinds with short-run r* below its long-run value to enjoying tailwinds, meaning that the short-run value of r* will likely, at some point over the medium term, temporarily exceed its long-run value. Two of the main reasons for that transition are the shift to an expansionary fiscal policy and the synchronized global expansion, and the effects of both are likely to play out over time. Although the tax cuts are already in place, the full effects on spending may not be seen for a few years. Similarly, the spend-out arising from the recent budget agreement may occur with some delay, which will stretch out the effect of the agreed appropriations. And, as we discussed yesterday, there\\u2019s a fair likelihood that the elevated spending levels could be extended somewhat beyond the two-year window. Similarly, the process of recovery abroad in some advanced foreign economies is gaining momentum only gradually, just as it did here. I also believe the gradual pace is warranted in light of the long period of undershooting our inflation target. As many have said, it\\u2019s encouraging that the latest inflation readings are very close to our objective, but on the conventional over-the-year measure, that\\u2019s been true for only one month. Moreover, given a long period of underperformance near the lower bound and the slippage we had seen in various measures of expected inflation, it\\u2019s reasonable to conclude that longer-run underlying inflation is running somewhat below our target. We will want to see inflation remaining in a narrow band around the 2 percent objective on a sustained basis to ensure underlying inflation is re-anchored at 2 percent. Unfortunately, there\\u2019s little precision in our understanding of the lags in the inflation process. A key tenet of monetary policy had been that inflation responds with a lag to tightening resource utilization, and that, of course, underlies the case for acting preemptively to prevent a later outbreak of inflation. But my reading of the empirical evidence is mixed. While the May 1\\u20132, 2018 135 of 185 evidence is fairly strong that such a lag was an important part of the inflation process in the 1960s and 1970s, when inflation expectations may have been less well anchored, it is also the case that, over the past 30 years or so, the evidence of lags seems to be far weaker\\u2014with some studies suggesting that the relationship between inflation and aggregate demand has become roughly contemporaneous. If there is indeed only a short lag, preemptively accelerating the pace of tightening could raise the risk that inflation expectations get entrenched somewhat below 2 percent. Preemptive acceleration could also contribute to an inversion of the yield curve\\u2014 something that, as many have noted, has been an important antecedent to recessions in the U.S. context. On the other hand, a too gradual removal of accommodation will likely mean that resource utilization will tighten further with an economy growing above trend. Historically, periods with very high levels of resource utilization have been associated with either elevated risks of an outbreak of inflation, the \\u201cold school\\u201d risk, or elevated risks of financial imbalances, a risk we\\u2019ve seen play out in the past two or three cycles. I agree with the cautions expressed by Presidents Kaplan and Evans. I don\\u2019t underestimate the challenge of calibrating monetary policy to sustain full employment and re-anchor trend inflation around 2 percent while adjusting to sizable stimulus at a time when resource utilization is high and the economy is growing above trend. Nonetheless, although I want to remain very vigilant for both types of risks, I view continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate to be appropriate and, for that reason, support alternative B. In addition, as I\\u2019ve noted previously\\u2014and echoing sentiments expressed by many of you\\u2014the forward guidance in paragraph 4 is increasingly awkward, and I would support removing it as soon as the next meeting. With sizable fiscal stimulus, supportive financial May 1\\u20132, 2018 136 of 185 conditions, and foreign growth likely to provide a boost to demand in the near-to-medium term that should fade somewhat further out, it would be reasonable to expect the neutral rate in the medium term to rise above its longer-run value while leaving little imprint on the long-run neutral rate. More broadly, as President George pointed out, conditions no longer merit this kind of forward guidance, and Committee members\\u2019 outlook is well summarized in the median SEP numbers. I also support moving to language in paragraph 3 that suggests policy is oriented to sustaining our dual-mandate objectives when we gain greater confidence in the inflation outlook. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. President Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B as written, with the amended language in Thomas\\u2019s briefing. I do have to make a brief remark about Governor Quarles\\u2019s very nice thought experiment that you\\u2019re feeling your skin is warm and you\\u2019re not sure why. I will say that I think this inversion of the yield curve is more about, do you have a high fever, or do you have a severe sunburn? In either case, you want to go to the doctor. [Laughter] So that\\u2019s the way I think about it. Anyway, going back to supporting alternative B, I repeat, I think, what most everyone said. Recent data have been in line with the strong economic baseline described in our March forecasts. Job gains are averaging well above their sustainable pace even as we stretch well beyond full employment. On the inflation side, the latest data show inflation essentially at 2 percent. And with all indicators pointing to a strong economic outlook, I\\u2019m increasingly confident that this will be a sustained achievement of our target. May 1\\u20132, 2018 137 of 185 I\\u2019m very sympathetic to the views expressed by a number of people, though, that this is not the time to declare \\u201cmission accomplished\\u201d on inflation. We have had just one month at the 12-month change in terms of core inflation, so I think we have to be cautious here. I\\u2019m confident that we\\u2019re going to have a sustained 2 percent inflation\\u2014a little bit of an overshoot\\u2014but, at the same time, I don\\u2019t think we should get ahead of ourselves about declaring victory. Against the background of these conditions, it is appropriate to maintain a steady but gradual pace of policy normalization. The language in alternative B allows us to hold rates fixed today but also validates expectations for an increase in the target range in June, barring any earth-shattering surprises before that meeting. And I continue to see a total of four rate increases this year as appropriate, in view of the very favorable outlook for the economy and inflation. As we look ahead to the June meeting, the draft language of alternative C serves as a good template for updating the statement language for the reasons that many have talked about. Some of the language in our current statement clearly needs to be changed in coming months. For example, as I\\u2019ve mentioned and many others have mentioned a number of times already, the language in paragraph 4 that suggests the federal funds rate is likely to remain below long-run levels for some time is getting past its sell-by date. In particular, it runs counter to the projected overshooting of the neutral rate in the median SEP. Similarly, the language on closely monitoring inflation and inflation expectations served us well when we were undershooting our target but may be confusing when we\\u2019re at the target or actually in the period when we\\u2019re modestly overshooting the 2 percent target. In addition, as I noted in some of my comments yesterday, we have seen a significant improvement in the economic outlook, but we haven\\u2019t changed our underlying view of appropriate policy. I do think that, as the economy continues to progress, we will want to have May 1\\u20132, 2018 138 of 185 more optionality for the reasons that Governor Brainard and many others talked about, I see this as optionality whether you\\u2019re thinking about it as alternative A or alternative C in the future. It could be that the economy performs much stronger, and this gradual rate increase path may not be appropriate. It could be that, as I believe, the neutral rate is low, and that if the economy underperforms, we will not want to continue with increases four times a year or some kind of gradual path like that. So I do think we want to have more optionality on how we describe our future policy moves. And for that reason, I do think that we will want to step away from the explicit forward guidance that we have in paragraph 4 at the appropriate time. Again, I think alternative C provides a really nice approach to doing that sometime in the future. That said, none of these changes in statement language should occur today for reasons a number of people mentioned. I think that any of these changes, whether in paragraph 1, 2, 3, or 4, really do require some explanation by the Chairman at the press conference to make sure that people do not see what we\\u2019re doing as a shift in our reaction function, but instead as a movement along the reaction function reflecting the really strong economy and, again, the much better data we\\u2019re seeing on inflation and other indicators. We\\u2019ll have time to calibrate the evolution of the statement based on economic developments in coming months. Again, I think it does make sense to do this in the press conference meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Chair Dudley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B as written. As I see it, the key issue is whether the change in language could be interpreted as signaling the potential for a faster pace of monetary policy tightening in the future by acknowledging that inflation has now \\u201cmoved close to\\u201d and is expected to \\u201crun near our symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\\u201d The statement does signal progress May 1\\u20132, 2018 139 of 185 toward our inflation objective. I think it\\u2019s going to be important in our public communications to indicate that this outcome was what we\\u2019ve actually been anticipating, and that we still remain on a gradual path of removing monetary policy accommodation. Although inflation has gotten back to near 2 percent, our target is symmetric. Moreover, I think it is very premature to signal that we\\u2019ve reached our objective, because I think the inflation data are noisy; I talked about this yesterday. Some of the upward pressure on the core PCE index appears, at least from my vantage point, to be due to transitory factors, so it\\u2019s possible that we could see core PCE inflation turn back down again. Turning to alternative C, I do think it provides a good template, should we decide to remove further monetary policy accommodation at the June meeting. As I see it, the removal of the language in paragraph 4 will be important in two respects. First, the removal would make it clear that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my mind, it\\u2019d be the final step in \\u201cwalking back\\u201d from forward guidance, a step that I think is appropriate. Second, by removing the language that we expect \\u201cthe federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,\\u201d it should signal that, as the federal funds rate gets closer to what we judge as neutral, we\\u2019re becoming more agnostic about what comes next. Now, by themselves, the changes in alternative C, including the removal of the \\u201cgradual increases\\u201d language in paragraph 4, might be taken by some as implying a more aggressive policy stance. If we go with alternative C or something close to that as the postmeeting statement in June, I expect that this risk will be out there, and we just need to be aware of it. I think it\\u2019s mitigated by two things, however. Number one, the second paragraph will keep the \\u201cgradual increases\\u201d language. And number two is the fact that we\\u2019ll have the Summary of May 1\\u20132, 2018 140 of 185 Economic Projections, which I think won\\u2019t change much from the March meeting. So I think those will anchor and push against that potential risk. Finally, I want to return to the issue of the flattening of the Treasury yield curve. There are several reasons why I don\\u2019t share this concern that the flattening of the yield curve foreshadows an economic slowdown or, if it continues further, which seems likely, a recession in the next year or two. First, we should be expecting the curve to flatten when we\\u2019re raising our federal funds rate target. If the curve weren\\u2019t flattening, this would suggest that we\\u2019re behind the curve in removing monetary policy accommodation. Second, I don\\u2019t think the yield curve flattening is particularly pronounced. The current spread between the yields on the 2-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury note is really roughly average compared with historical experience when you don\\u2019t include the past decade. And I really do think that you want to exclude the past decade from your calculation for two reasons. Number one, it was a very deep recession, so that meant there was a long period to get back to full employment. During that period, the yield curve is going to be very, very steep. Number two, I don\\u2019t think you want to include it because you\\u2019re including only part of a business cycle. You\\u2019re including the part of the business cycle in which the yield curve is steep, but you\\u2019re not including the part of the business cycle in which the yield curve was flat or inverted. So I think if you\\u2019re doing this analysis about what\\u2019s normal, you should be basically looking at complete business cycles. Third, we should expect the yield curve to be flatter than normal because term premiums are depressed. And I think flatness due to lower term premiums is different from flatness due to expectations that short-term interest rates are high and are likely to fall in the future. So, to me, what matters is not the shape of the yield curve per se, but whether monetary policy is indeed May 1\\u20132, 2018 141 of 185 tight. If short-term rates are high relative to what is likely to occur over the longer term, then investors will expect short-term rates to fall in the future, and the yield curve will be flat or invert to reflect such expectations. Now, in the current environment, I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s where we are at all. I think monetary policy is still viewed as accommodative. If you look at federal funds rate futures contracts a few years out, they climb to about 2.7 percent, and then they\\u2019re sort of flat after that. That implies market participants believe that a neutral federal funds rate is 2\\u00bd or higher, and that\\u2019s not really that different from our implied SEP median long-term federal funds rate of 3 percent. Also, this is market expectations, and the markets don\\u2019t always get it right. Even if the yield curve were to flatten, I don\\u2019t think we want to take this onboard literally and say, \\u201cWell, the market thinks that the curve is inverted. Therefore, short-term rates are high.\\u201d We have to make our independent judgment about whether monetary policy is, in fact, tight. Finally, while the inverted yield curve has typically preceded recession, I\\u2019m not aware of any causal element in this. This is all just about expectations. I\\u2019m not aware of banks being unwilling to lend because the yield curve inverts. I think that all that happens is, when the yield curve is inverted, it\\u2019s because people think that short-term rates are high relative to what they\\u2019re going to be in the future, and that\\u2019s it. There\\u2019s no causal aspect to this. So I think what\\u2019s going to happen is, the yield curve is going to continue to flatten as we remove monetary policy accommodation. And I would imagine that inversion might happen earlier than normal because term premiums are depressed. But worrying now that we\\u2019re about to commit a major policy mistake because the curve is flattening somewhat seems completely misplaced. Our tightening moves have not appreciably tightened financial market conditions. May 1\\u20132, 2018 142 of 185 They\\u2019ve tightened a little bit. So if that\\u2019s the case, why should we expect our actions to exert a significant restraining effect on economic activity at this point? The answer is straightforward from my perspective: We shouldn\\u2019t. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. And thanks to everyone for a thoughtful discussion. I particularly appreciate the comments on alternative C, which I think give us a head start on thinking about what will be important changes to the statement should the Committee decide to move in June. The decision today seems quite straightforward. I\\u2019ve heard strong support for alternative B as written. So let me now ask Jim Clouse to make clear what the FOMC will vote on and then to read the roll. Thank you. The vote will be on the monetary policy statement as it appears on page 4 of Thomas Laubach\\u2019s briefing materials. The vote will also encompass the directive to the Desk as it appears in the implementation note on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas\\u2019s briefing materials. Chairman Powell Vice Chairman Dudley President Barkin President Bostic Governor Brainard President Mester Governor Quarles President Williams Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Thank you. Now we have two sets of related matters under the Board\\u2019s jurisdiction: corresponding interest rates on reserves and discount rates. I first need a motion from a Board member to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1\\u00be percent. So moved. May 1\\u20132, 2018 143 of 185 Second? Second. Without objection. Finally, I need a motion from a Board member to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing rate of 2\\u00bc percent and establishment of the rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas specified in the staff\\u2019s April 27 memo to the Board. So moved. Second? Seconded. Without objection. Thanks very much. Our final agenda item is to confirm that the next meeting will be on Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 and 13. And that concludes the meeting. We have your boxed lunches ready for those of you who eat at 10:00 a.m. [Laughter] Thanks very much, everybody, and travel safely.\",\n          \"Good afternoon, everyone. Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of the May 18 meeting? So move. Without objection. Mr. Fisher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the usual package of colored charts that is in front of you. 1/ Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, four perceptions are currently influencing financial market behavior. It seems to me that each of these perceptions contains certain elements of truth but also, I fear, certain fallacies that could come back to haunt us. These perceptions are: First, that signs of a pickup in European growth are causing a rise in expectations for a European Central Bank (ECB) rate hike later this year; second, that the strength of the U.S. economy has been the major factor causing the weakening of the euro over the last six months; third, that the Japanese monetary authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen with verbal and official intervention; and fourth, that the levels of interest rates and of economic activity in the United States will be principally determined by the words and deeds of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee. In my remarks, I will address each of these perceptions in turn. In the charts on the first page of the package, you can see that the forward rates jumped a bit on the Committee's announcement on May 18 but stabilized or even rallied a bit until May 27 and then began to back up through most of June. I will return to the issue of the course of U.S. interest rates later when I discuss the bond market. For now, I would like to focus on the euro forward rates, which appear to have followed U.S. rates up. Euro-area 6-month and 9-month forward 3-month deposit rates are up 25 basis points or so since your last meeting. There have been a number of positive signs for the euro-11 economy, including greater-than-expected first-quarter GDP in Germany, increased German manufacturing orders, and improvement in German and French business sentiment. But some less upbeat data have also been reported in Europe, including an increase in German unemployment in May, a decrease in German retail sales in April, weak French exports in 1 / A copy of the material used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1) 6/29-30/99                                    2 April, and weak Italian production in April. So, while some signs of a bottoming in the European economy have emerged, I don't think that translates directly into concrete expectations of an ECB rate hike. Rather, evidence of a slight pickup in activity coupled with strong expectations for U.S. rate increases, against the backdrop of a weak euro, have completely eliminated any expectations of further rate cuts by the ECB and in that sense have increased the risks of a rate hike. But this has left euro-area interest rate markets without any direction, leaving them highly susceptible to being dragged around by the movement in U.S. rates. Unfortunately, I did not include in these charts a panel on the German yield curve. But in the period since your last meeting the 10-year German bund and, most surprisingly, the 2-year German bund have marched along with our yield curve almost in lock step as they too have backed up over the last 60 days. It may turn out that the euro-area economy has turned and will pick up steam from this point forward, but most of the backup in euro-area interest rates appears to me to be a case of their following our lead. In the bottom panel of this chart, which depicts Japanese forward rates, you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate backed up following the report of a much stronger-than-expected GDP number for the first quarter. Then, it seems to me, the data go berserk in this panel. Even though we have checked and doubled checked them, this is the best we have been able to come up with. But you should also recognize that this scale is twice that of the other panels on this chart in order to provide any view at all of Japanese interest rates. There is a level of noise in the Japanese markets that I don't even pretend to understand. But I will hold with my assessment that I don't think anyone really expects the Bank of Japan to raise rates any time soon. There is much seesawing in views about what to expect in the Tankan survey. Every few days authorities step forward to say they still think the economy is weak, and this has been going on for some time. Turning to the next chart, the steady weakening of the euro against the dollar since its launch in January has been widely attributed to the surprising strength of the U.S. economy. Obviously, the relative strength of the U.S. economy versus the European economies has played a role in the movements of the dollar against the euro but it does not explain the weakness of the euro against the yen. It strikes me that if one wants to make the case that Europe's growth differential with the United States has been the principal cause of the euro's weakness, one needs to look at the relationships among all three currencies. If one does that, I think it is evident that the yen has been playing a dominant role, both in the last six months and over the last two years. 6/29-30/99                                    3 In the third page of charts, the top panel presents a view of G-3 exchange rates from the dollar's perspective, depicting the value since January of 1997 of one dollar in terms of the euro in red and the value of one dollar in terms of the yen divided by one hundred in green. The bottom panel provides a view of exchange rates from the yen's perspective, depicting the value of one hundred yen in dollars, the green line, and the value of 100 yen in euros, the blue line. With the naked eye I think you can see that the yen-based pair in the bottom panel track each other much more closely than the dollar-based pair in the top panel. Comparing the correlation coefficients noted in the subperiods in the top and bottom panels, you can see that the only period in which the daily changes of the dollar pair tracked more closely was from January through April of 1997. From May 1997 onward, when the unwinding of the yen carry trades began to put pressure on the Thai baht, the daily changes in the yen pair have correlated much more closely. Now, neither of these graphs nor the correlations is proof that the yen is the principal driver of the G-3 exchange rates. But I do think the data powerfully suggest that the differences between North America on the one hand and Europe on the other are much less significant than the differences, as expressed in exchange rates, between Japan on the one hand and North America and Europe on the other. If euro/yen and dollar/yen are moving to the beat of one drum, there is only so much room left for independent expression in the euro/dollar exchange rate. Again, I certainly believe that differences in growth prospects between the United States and the euro-11 influence the euro/dollar exchange rate. But I also think that the weak Japanese economy and the crippled Japanese financial system have had an oscillating influence on portfolio allocations that in turn have had a significant impact on the major exchange rates--an impact that has been ignored by those who do not take the time to consider all three sides of the triangle. Turning to the fourth page of charts, the top panel depicts euro/yen and dollar/yen exchange rates as they have traded since the start of the year. The bottom panel shows the implied volatilities of one-month options on all three of the major currency pairs since the start of the year. Now, the third perception I mentioned at the outset was that the Japanese authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen with verbal and official intervention. The germ of truth in that perception is that the Japanese authorities have stabilized the yen so far this year, at least to some appearances. The problem is that the market's apparent reliance on the authorities' ability to do so is likely to be misplaced. On January 12, 6/29-30/99                                     4 indicated by the vertical line on the left in the top panel, the Japanese authorities purchased                 And the shaded area on the right indicates the               of dollar intervention and the              of euro intervention the Japanese authorities conducted in mid-June. While there was a modest uptick in the implied volatilities, as shown in the bottom panel, what surprises me is how little and how short-lived that reaction was. Indeed, dollar/yen and euro/yen implied volatilities are back to their lows of the year. Anecdotal evidence from the market suggests strongly that many who have exposures are simply leaving them unhedged and that others are eager to write options and collect premiums, leaving themselves unhedged, all in the expectation that the Japanese authorities will keep the yen contained. It is possible that the yen will stabilize; I don't want to rule that out entirely. But I think it is more likely that the reliance on that expectation will simply delay the position adjustments--or worse, will encourage an entirely new round of yen carry trades. The fifth page of charts addresses the last perception I mentioned- that the levels of interest rates and of economic activity in the United States will be determined principally by the words and deeds of the members of this Committee. I should, of course, point out that there is an element of truth behind that perception also, particularly with respect to the predictable impact of the Committee's deeds on short-term rates. Within the last few weeks, in the absence of what we might normally think of as noteworthy data, it seems to me that bond yields have been pushed higher by a medley of unattributed voices. The top panel depicts several stages of the bond market's movements since your last meeting. First, I think it is worth noting that in the days following the Committee's announcement on May 18 the bond market rallied. The long bond rallied every day that week; along the rest of the yield curve other bonds backed up on the day after the announcement but rallied for the rest of the week. Now, in defense of the market, I don't think its initial reaction was unreasonable. After all, the 10-year Treasury had already backed up 50 basis points in yield from early April. I think the market took some pleasure in seeing that the central bank was preparing to react to the perceived risk of inflation but did not plan to do so abruptly or in a knee- jerk fashion. I think it is also worth noting that many market participants interpreted the FOMC's announcement as implying a heightened risk of a 25 basis point increase in rates. However, beginning on May 27, the market began receiving a series of reports about the views of the Committee, including comments by FOMC members and other Fed officials suggesting that a more aggressive tightening should be expected. This threat, giving the market a new sense 6/29-30/99                                    5 of risk, triggered a backup in yields and anxious reactions to several not particularly significant data releases. On June 1 the long bond backed up 11 basis points after the NAPM prices paid index came in at 55.2 rather than closer to the expected 53.3. On June 4 the bond market backed up only 3 basis points in reaction to the release of the data on employment and average hourly wages; but then on June 11 it backed up 9 basis points after the report of a 1 percent increase in retail sales versus expectations of 0.7 or 0.8 percent. Subsequently, the release of the flat CPI on June 16 and the Chairman's June 17 testimony before the Joint Economic Committee calmed the market with a perception that a moderate tightening was in store. But as you can see on the chart, the \\\"relief rally\\\" was short-lived. By early last week, the market was once again on the receiving end of a chorus of voices threatening more aggressive actions. In my judgment, if you had tried to trade in the bond market during this period and had followed only the FOMC's announcement on May 18, the data releases as they came out, and the Chairman's Joint Economic Committee testimony, you would have lost a lot of money. On the other hand, if you had subscribed to all the high-priced insider rags and carefully tracked the utterances, attributed and unattributed, of FOMC members, you would have fared a good bit better. Looking at the bottom two panels on this page, you can see that credit spreads and volatilities did back up a little, but not very much--less than I would have expected, given all the fits and starts in the bond market. I think it is particularly noteworthy that the implied volatility on the S&P futures contract was actually lower on the period. In sum, there seems to be a very odd mix of anxiety and complacency in this market, which I don't pretend to understand fully nor do I yet see how it will work itself out. Finally, turning to domestic open market operations, the chart on page 6 depicts the volatility of the fed funds rate. We had significantly less volatility and a much better contained funds market during this period than we had earlier in the year. The red dots cover the intermeeting period and the blue dots cover the period from January 14 through May 18. As you can see, the median value of the effective deviation from the target in absolute terms was only 5 basis points and the standard deviation was down to 8 basis points during the recent intermeeting period. So we have had a much calmer funds market and funds have traded a bit on the soft side. 6/29-30/99                                    6 The rather extraordinary conditions in the current maintenance period have posed something of a challenge for the Desk. The market had a very low appetite for reserves coming into this period, expecting to hold large quantities of excess reserves at the quarter-end. And even as we left reserves quite short, the market traded on the soft side. Last Thursday, as the market began to turn its attention to the shortage for this week, we arranged a 3-day forward RP for settlement Monday to inject about $7 billion to cover these last days. But given the combination of events tomorrow--a quarter-end, a maintenance period end, and a very high expectation that the Committee will raise rates--it has been rather hard to get the funds rate to trade very far below 5 percent, even though I think we have finally succeeded in that effort today. I will be candid, however; I have some fears that our efforts to do this over a Monday and Tuesday will lead to a fed funds rate of zero by tomorrow night, notwithstanding your announcement, whatever it may be. I should mention that over the first six months of the year the SOMA portfolio has expanded by almost $30 billion, which is a record expansion of our outright holdings. This has been in response principally to currency in circulation, but we have been adding to the portfolio all along the maturity spectrum. Even with the slightly stronger currency growth, we still think that the normal $12 billion leeway will be adequate for the coming intermeeting period. Mr. Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations during the period but I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations. And I would be happy to answer any questions. Questions for Peter? Just a quick question on your chart discussion, Peter: On the third page where you were talking about the cross rates, I am wondering as I read the portion of the bottom panel covering 1999 whether things may be changing. It looks as if the correlation between dollar/yen and euro/yen is diminishing in relation to what it was in earlier periods. Maybe the opposite is happening in the top panel. Am I looking at that right? Our perception is very much that the daily changes are still being driven by the yen. The anxiety of the Japanese authorities is now as much focused on euro/yen as dollar/yen, and they intervened in euro/yen for the first time ever during this period. I agree with you but I think some other things are going on here; I don't mean to suggest that this encompasses all of the inputs that determine exchange rates. Still, during 6/29-30/99                                    7 these six months and even in recent weeks, the daily changes up and down in euro/yen and dollar/yen seem to be moving together. Although I did not refer to this in my remarks, we hear anecdotally that there is a sense among market participants, both in Europe and in Japan, that a lot of the pressure on the yen reflects Japanese investors who had established positions in Europe and are coming back into yen now that they are deeply under water. What you can't tell from this panel, because it is not expressed in terms of exchange rates, is that at the end of September of last year, the end of Japan's fiscal half-year, euro/yen was at 160. Now it is at 124 or so. So, anyone from Japan who took on a position in euro assets at that earlier point is deeply under water. It is actually a widespread perception in Tokyo that the Ministry of Finance's incentive to intervene was to try to help institutional investors get out of those positions without strengthening the yen. So, other things are certainly going on. The sense of the strong U.S. economy vis--vis Europe is also certainly apropos. President Parry. Peter, I have a question for you or Karen about the huge Japanese support of the yen. Has this intervention been sterilized completely or partially? The numbers are so large that they would have great significance for their monetary base, and I just wondered what the policy is. The normal course that I believe the Bank of Japan is following is that they sterilize this intervention. It is a very complicated arrangement. It's as if the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the equivalent accounting entity, could actually issue its own bills to the market to finance itself. That's in effect what the Bank of Japan does on behalf of the Ministry. So in the first step, the Bank of Japan gives the Ministry yen liquidity. But the Ministry then has to finance that by borrowing yen in the markets and issuing securities directly to repay the Bank of Japan; it would be the accounting equivalent of the Exchange Stabilization Fund issuing its own bills directly. So it is sterilized. I think that question is different from the question of the extent of accommodation in the Bank of Japan's monetary stance. It is still a very accommodative stance. They have managed to keep their overnight rate trading at 2 or 3 basis points, which is the brokers' spread. So that rate has been effectively zero throughout the period. 6/29-30/99                                    8 I think that \\\"zero\\\" is the magic word. Whatever intervention the Bank of Japan chooses to do, whether it is in domestic assets or in foreign exchange- and the latter is what they have been doing--they no longer have room on the downside at the very short-term end of the money market to lower interest rates any further. So in that sense there is no such thing as unsterilized intervention because there is no place to go. There are lots of people out there arguing about whether or not allowing the monetary base to continue to expand under those circumstances has expansionary influences, and through what channels. We are obviously looking for the latter in Japan. But in the most ordinary sense of sterilized and unsterilized intervention, both in terms of what happened on the balance sheet and whether it did or did not affect short-term money market interest rates, the answer would be that they have sterilized. That is rather interesting because, of course, we often think about sterilization not necessarily in terms of the impact on rates but on the monetary base. At this point, the change in the Japanese monetary base doesn't seem to be having any particular implications. At least changes of this order of magnitude can't be perceived as being followed by changes, for example, in better lending conditions and increased bank credit creation. I think it is instructive that the Japanese are creating what essentially are very useful experiments in intervention, whether we call it sterilized or otherwise. As you may recall, they sold              in U.S. dollars and bought yen a while back with very modest, if any, effects. They have done the reverse this time, except they have added another             or so in euro, with little effect. Many economists would argue theoretically that sterilized intervention cannot affect exchange rates materially. What the Japanese have succeeded in doing is proving that proposition. Vice Chair. Peter, considering that the earlier version of the yen carry trade contributed so dangerously to the Thai baht explosion in July 1997, are you and your colleagues at other central banks able to track reasonably well the buildup of that so we can take any supervisory action that is appropriate? 6/29-30/99                                       9 At the aggregate level, it is quite hard; the data are rather poor. At the firm level, I presume one can find out what decisions individual firms have made. Tracking this involves relying on anecdotal information. There was an attempt to tabulate some data for Japan, which was not very satisfactory. The results were published by some outfit here in Washington whose name I don't recall, but the data were pretty poor once you scratched the surface. When I checked with the Bank of Japan, they told us to be very suspicious of those data. So unfortunately, the answer is no, we cannot track that at an aggregate level. But it is something we are always talking about with others in the market and we get some anecdotal information. I don't know how accurate that is. So some supervisory sniffing around might be appropriate? Yes, it is certainly easier to try to get a handle on it at the firm level. President McTeer. Peter, I think you have gotten a little too subtle for me and I am not sure I'm following you. Why did you choose to focus on this issue of whether it is a yen thing or a dollar phenomenon? What significance do you think that has for the Committee? I am worried about the risk that people perceive it as a dollar thing when in fact I think it is a yen thing. I think sloppy policies, sloppy policy reactions, and uninformed market behavior can result if people think they are responding to one stimulus when that stimulus really isn't the dominant one. So my first instinct is to make sure my thinking is as clear as I can make it regarding what may be influencing exchange rates. That is really the major thrust of my message, nothing more than that. Did Japan ever intervene with marks? No, they did not. They hold a few marks but I don't believe they ever formally intervened in marks. So this could be the beginning of the euro as an intervention currency? This is the first time it was ever used that way? 6/29-30/99                                    10 It was the first time it was used by the Japanese. I think it reflected a certain flamboyance on the part of the Ministry of Finance, trying to grab attention for itself in Tokyo. But also, to be fair, a lot of the pressures were emanating from the movement in euro/yen. So to the extent they wanted to respond, they realized that if they only intervened in dollar/yen, it would be a release valve and would be hard to get their hands on the problem. So there was a tactical reason, but I think flamboyance might also have been a reason. I was very surprised to see the ECB begin a relationship by intervening as agent on behalf of the Japanese authorities because the Bundesbank had always resisted doing that. I should be clear that this normal courtesy may increasingly become something of an artifact since most of the foreign exchange market trades through a single computer, or at least the price setting takes place in the electronic brokering system (EBS) terminal. So liquidity is not a geographic phenomenon; it is a temporal phenomenon of when people are connected to and are watching the EBS. So we may get away from this notion of geographic intervention, but that hasn't quite happened yet. I believe your fourth point was that people seem to be reacting to rhetoric more than to the statistics. What was the significance of bringing that to our attention? I think the bond market has been focused on the words of members of this Committee, both for attribution and not, to an extent that I have not seen in my admittedly not very long tenure in this position. I find that disturbing in terms of the influence on policy. It looks to me as if this bond market has priced in a 25 basis point move about four times. I can't prove that and I don't know that. Cumulatively? They have taken that 25 basis point increase in and out. I am not suggesting that that has any profound macroeconomic effect. But the in and out pricing repetitions have been in response to the rhetoric, not the economic data. That was my point. 6/29-30/99                                    11 Do you think the announcement of the bias in the directive is part of this? Clearly something very different happened after the last meeting with the announcement of a bias. I said at the end of my remarks that there is a strange mix of what market players are anxious about and what they are complacent about. I looked for a way to express to the Committee what I thought they were anxious about and what I thought they were complacent about. I think their focus is misplaced but, to be candid, I can't quite put my finger on it. They seem to have some expectation that words from this Committee, whether individually or collectively, will somehow remove all the uncertainties. That is rather nave and myopic. But they hang on every word as if it were going to solve the uncertainties for them. I just don't think it will. Indeed, it hasn't, as you can see by how the bond market has behaved. So if I was not clear enough, I hope that helps. President Jordan. Some of the initial commentary I saw after the announcement by the Japanese in early June of their first-quarter number was along the lines that it was a statistical fluke or window-dressing. The view was that it wasn't real and that by year- end we would see the Japanese economy back in the tank again. A fair amount of the commentary had the tone of: \\\"This is something we did not forecast so it couldn't possibly be true.\\\" More recently, I have seen more commentaries suggesting that the first quarter may have represented a turning point, though the GDP number may be exaggerated, and that from this point forward Japan would be viewed as having seen the worst. Is there any dominance of one opinion or the other in the street? I certainly defer to Karen for a view on the real merits of what you've suggested. In terms of the view on the Street, I think most non-Japanese observers are still highly skeptical. They are not yet in the camp that thinks this is for real, although they are intrigued and are wondering where the opportunities may be. After all, the Nikkei turned up. So there is a little bait-on-the-hook dangling there for them. I think the Japanese are quite anxious and wondering if it is time to bring their money home. The quantities do not matter, but the price should. So in Tokyo there is a lot of anxiety about that. There also is a lot of anxiety about what the impact on Japan 6/29-30/99                                     12 might be of any action by this Committee. It doesn't make any sense to me, but they think that if this Committee raises rates, it will strengthen the yen. And that actually is an issue within Japan as well. So I think the anxieties about this being a turning point are somewhat geographically separated, if I can put it that way. But if Karen wants to add anything on the specifics- I will defer my comments on that until after the Chart Show, since we are going to go into some of those issues as we return to honest-to-goodness real economics! [Laughter] Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions? Move approval of the domestic open market operations. Without objection. Let's move on to the Chart Show. Mike Prell. I don't know how real the economics are, but there are tangible charts to which we will be referring. 2/ I thought I'd begin with a brief update on the second quarter, taking into account a few data we've received since the Greenbook was completed. As usual at this point, we're still attempting to blend the labor market data with the expenditure figures to get a fix on current-quarter GDP. The relationship is loose, but the weaker growth of production worker hours in April and May, shown in the upper left panel of Chart 1, suggests that we should look for a moderation of real output growth this quarter. Considering the spending numbers as well, our best guess for the real GDP increase is still about 3 percent. Yesterday's report on consumer spending for May contained no major surprises. Anticipating a moderate increase in June, we see real PCE this quarter running something over 4 percent--off markedly from the 6 percent first-quarter pace. Housing starts, at the middle left, fell off considerably on average in April and May--we think mainly because of limited supplies of labor and materials, rather than any shortage of demand. Owing to the lags between 2 / A copy of the material used by Mr. Prell and Ms. Johnson is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 2) 6/29-30/99                                   13 starts and construction outlays, real residential investment probably will be up, but only modestly, this quarter. As plotted at the right, last week's advance report from manufacturers showed that shipments of non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, were strong through May. This reinforces our view that there will be a hefty increase in PDE this quarter, although various anecdotes and the NAPM survey would suggest that some of the rise in shipments of capital goods might show up in export sales. In that regard, the panel at the lower left shows that overall exports firmed in April. Even so, the trade gap still was somewhat larger than the first-quarter average, as we continued to exhibit an enormous appetite for imports. Turning to the right panel, it would appear that few of those imports ended up in business inventories in April. The book value of manufacturing and trade stocks, ex motor vehicles, rose only modestly- roughly matching the first-quarter rate of accumulation. All told, then, the picture is one of a step-down in GDP growth this quarter. But final demand can scarcely be said to have turned weak--and inventories probably are lean enough that desires to build stocks will spur production in coming months. With that prelude, let me turn to the summary of the staff forecast, contained in Chart 2. As has been the case for a long time now, we are projecting a considerable moderation in the trend of real GDP growth. The quarterly numbers represented by the bars in the upper left panel gyrate later this year and in early 2000 because of our allowance for some Y2K effects, but the general drift is toward a slightly sub-par growth trend. Being just slightly sub-par, though, that growth probably would be sufficient to hold the unemployment rate in the low 4s through next year. Largely, but not solely, because of the continued tightness of the labor market, we're expecting that the rate of inflation will trend higher, as may be seen in the bottom panels. The recent rebound in crude oil prices generates an acceleration of the overall CPI to a 2 percent increase this year; a leveling of oil prices holds total CPI inflation at the same average pace in 2000 even as the core component accelerates. The acceleration in overall GDP prices is smoother, because the direct oil price effects on this index are smaller. As we emphasized in the Greenbook, the stock market outlook--the subject of the next chart--is quite central to our forecast. With the \\\"drag\\\" from the external sector likely to be diminishing, the projected moderation 6/29-30/99                                    14 of GDP growth hinges on a substantial slackening in the growth of domestic demand. The half percentage point funds rate increase we've assumed to occur in the next several months and the sustained higher level of intermediate- and long-term interest rates should work in that direction. However, a cessation of the uptrend in share prices is an important ingredient as well, and whether that is indeed at hand is open to question. The top left panel updates the provocative comparison of the 1920s and 1990s bull markets that I included in the last chart show. We're still pretty much on track, with some upside ahead of us. Certainly, the fact that the market has given up so little ground in the recent period of interest rate run-up is testament to the abiding exuberance of investors. That point is given further emphasis by the right panel, which shows the current extraordinary narrowness of the equity premium, as proxied by the gap between the earnings yield on the S&P 500, based on analysts' profit expectations for the coming twelve months, and the real 10-year Treasury rate. The middle panels plotting price-earnings multiples alone are perhaps less insightful analytically--but may still be of some interest. The left panel in particular illustrates that the run-up in PEs has been unusual in that it has occurred at a time so distant from a cyclical trough in profits. Together, as we've suggested repeatedly--and evidently wrongly- these indicators would seem to suggest that the market could be vulnerable to a quite sizable decline, if and as rosy corporate profit expectations are disappointed. Nonetheless, we've projected only a flattening in share prices. That still produces the decline in the household wealth-income ratio charted in the lower left panel, however, which should help take the steam out of consumer demand. The little table at the right is intended to highlight the relative potency of stock market effects today. Because of the huge run-up in the wealth- income ratio since the end of 1994, a given percentage change in share prices translates into a much greater consumption effect than before. As indicated, when we apply our standard rule of thumb to a 10 percent decline in share prices, the effect on real PCE growth in the ensuing year is now 0.4 percent, twice what it was earlier. In the Greenbook, we simulated a rapid 25 percent decline in the market, which had notable but not devastating effects on the growth of activity. Looking at the panels above, one might be able to envision a much deeper bear market. But, even with the simulation we performed, it might be asked whether there could not be greater effects on demand than predicted because of financial imbalances that our model cannot capture. 6/29-30/99                                    15 This is no simple matter to pin down, but Chart 4 provides a few clues. First, the upper panel tends to allay one concern. Although the volume of margin debt outstanding has skyrocketed, when scaled by the value of equities, as it is here, it doesn't look so startling. However, this is a very narrow measure of leveraging and consequent risk exposure. The right panel shows two aggregate ratios of households' indebtedness to their holdings of liquid assets. The black line reveals that debt has been rising considerably relative to holdings of the most liquid of financial assets--deposits, money funds, and governments. But the red line indicates that debt has been falling relative to a broader range of assets that comprises as well corporate and municipal securities and mutual funds. So, there's not much sign here that even though debt has been growing appreciably faster than income, household balance sheets in the aggregate have become more illiquid. Is there something lurking out there at a disaggregated level that might imply a different assessment? We've generated some preliminary tabulations from the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances to address that issue, and these are laid out in the middle panels. I'd note on the left panel that there's been a considerable shift in the distribution of household debt from those without stock (a smaller portion of the population today) to those who have significant amounts of stock--defined in the second column as a holding equal to at least one-half year's income. But, if shareholders have taken on a larger amount of debt, they've not incurred extraordinary debt-service burdens. As indicated in the second column of the right panel, the median monthly payment burden as a percent of income for significant shareholders has increased, but it is somewhere between the ratios for households with smaller or no shareholdings. I should add the caveat that the income concept in these ratios often includes realized capital gains, which might suggest the possibility of some greater exposure for the shareholding households, but another fact is that the significant shareholders also have relatively large amounts of other assets. Thus, even if one were to assume a very deep drop in the stock market, it would not generally have drastic effects on their ability to cover their debts. The bottom panels focus on another conceivable point of vulnerability, the banking system. As you can see at the left, the black line indicates that almost all banking assets are held by institutions that are well capitalized. The comfort one might draw from that fact today is perhaps a little less than would have been the case a couple of years ago, however, because--as shown by the red line--the margin by which the banks exceed their regulatory capital requirements has shrunk a bit. 6/29-30/99                                   16 If one were to think about how the banking system might be affected by a stock market plunge, at least one can rule out the more direct links that proved devastating in Japan when their bubble burst. Having consulted with our supervisory folks, it appears that the greatest concern might be that loans have been made to firms that have engaged in aggressively priced acquisitions, with the expectation that those loans will be repaid out of proceeds of subsequent stock or junk bond issues. The junk bond market looks better today than it did last fall, as reflected in the yield spread at the right; but with defaults already rising the spreads have remained appreciable. A broad retrenchment in stock prices might cause an edgy junk market to turn very sour and leave banks with either losses or impaired assets that would in turn make them more cautious lenders. My sense though, is that--short of a severe market setback--we are not talking about financial dislocations of such a scope and intensity that we need to mark up the customary wealth and cost-of-capital effects substantially. The kinds of pressures financial markets will face obviously will depend considerably on the amount of inflation that lies ahead. Chart 5 summarizes the labor market forces impinging on wages. Our forecast of labor demand is premised on what is, relative to prevailing professional norms, a pretty optimistic assessment of the dimension of recent and prospective structural gains in labor productivity. As you can see in the top panel, however, we're expecting that growth in output per hour will slow in the near term, not because the structural improvements will ebb, but because we expect that hiring won't be geared down immediately and commensurately as production decelerates. In any event, we don't foresee much relief from the labor market tightness. The labor force participation rate, plotted in the middle left panel, has been fluctuating in an essentially sideways direction for a while, after having risen a bit as people perhaps were drawn into the workforce partly by the perception that jobs were readily available. As indicated at the right, the percentage of respondents to the Conference Board survey who say that jobs are easy to get seems to be leveling out, and we're expecting labor force participation to remain in the recent range. In this tight labor market, workers have achieved some leverage in the wage-setting process, and we're forecasting that compensation increases, plotted at the lower left, will be tending to grow. We believe that we were probably correct in expecting that the low rate of price inflation in the past year or two would be moderating nominal wage increases, but the first- quarter fall-off in the ECI measure of compensation looks too low to believe. In fact, doing some rethinking, partly in light of other information that has come in of late, we have moved our ECI forecast back up noticeably this time, after having initially dropped it quite 6/29-30/99                                    17 markedly in response to the first-quarter surprise. But, the basic point, conveyed in the forecasts of both the ECI and the Productivity and Costs series for hourly compensation, is that tight labor markets--with a helping hand from Uncle Sam on the minimum wage front--are likely to produce ongoing large real pay increases. The right panel documents the real compensation gains in the forecast, responding in part to questions that have arisen at past meetings. I've based this on the Productivity and Costs series in part because it relates more directly to the movements in income shares in the NIPAs. The point that is highlighted here is that, though the projected real pay gains may look rather skimpy relative to productivity trends when they are measured against consumer prices, when they're measured against product prices they are quite sizable. Workers have been capturing a bigger share of the pie. This spells a squeeze on profit margins--unless businesses can find some leverage of their own on the pricing side. We don't think that they will do so, but there are some risks. As you can see in the top panel of the next chart, we have core consumer prices accelerating over the next year and a half. This reflects in part the labor cost pressures I've just described. In addition, there will be some pass-through into core prices of the rebound in oil prices via higher transportation costs and other channels. The middle left panel highlights another unfavorable factor--namely, the turn that is likely to occur in non-oil import prices as the dollar peaks and foreign economies manage to generate more domestic demand for their output. One can already observe that import price trends have become somewhat less favorable than they were earlier, with a rise in materials prices being a significant element in that pattern. Looking for signs of whether the tide might be turning in domestic prices, one indicator that people sometimes consult as a measure of so- called \\\"pipeline\\\" inflation is the PPI core intermediate component, graphed at the right. These prices don't bulk large in terms of their weight in overall production costs, but they can be an early indicator of broader inflationary pressures. They've probably now posted their first quarterly increase since 1997. Some of this is metals prices, which rallied in part on Asian growth prospects; some of it is the effect of higher petroleum feedstock costs; and some of it is the pressures on capacity in the construction materials industry. These don't quite smell like a broad- based inflationary surge, though. Moreover, the below-average overall factory utilization rate in our forecast, shown at the lower left, suggests that, although competitive pressures from abroad may ease a bit, a major flare-up in goods price inflation is not in the immediate offing. 6/29-30/99                                     18 There have been some comments in Reserve Bank reports that consumers have become somewhat less price conscious. This might suggest some shift in inflation expectations. The final panel shows the Michigan SRC median readings on 1 year and 5-to-10 year expectations. On the moving average basis plotted here to filter out some of the noise, both series are off their lows, but whether the downtrends of the past several years are in process of reversing is not clear. A sanguine--and quite plausible--interpretation would be that expectations were damped to an extra degree last year by the plunge in energy prices and that we have seen a one-time adjustment back up in light of the recent rebound in those prices. The pattern here is not dissimilar to those in the charts of the price series themselves: In neither case is the direction unambiguous and as a result they perhaps serve best as a sort of Rorschach test for one's degree of inflation phobia. Karen will now discuss the international picture. The general tone of developments abroad since the February chart show has been favorable. On balance, the repercussions of the spread of the global financial crisis to Latin America have not been as dire as we feared in February; signs of recovery in Asia have added to the sense that the crisis, as such, is at or near its end. Nevertheless, there is no lack of risks embedded in the current foreign outlook. A major element of the more sanguine outlook for the rest of the world is the perception that various financial market indicators are signaling progress in the real economy. Chart 7 shows selected real exchange rates and stock market indexes. The top pair refer to the major industrial countries. The black line on the left panel shows that on balance during 1999 the dollar has risen in real terms relative to an average of the major foreign currencies. In large part, that rise reflects the strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro (the blue line). The dollar has also risen on balance in real terms against the Japanese yen during 1999, but it remains far below the value it had reached in the middle of last year. In the forecast, we expect a gradual depreciation of the dollar in real terms against these currencies, as relative macroeconomic conditions become less supportive of the dollar and as market participants become more aware of the growing U.S. external imbalance--a topic to which I shall return at the end of my remarks. Stock prices for these countries, on the right, are among the financial indicators signaling optimism during the past several months. Although they declined sharply last August and September during the turmoil following the Russian debt moratorium, they have increased on balance so far in 1999, including the Japanese index. 6/29-30/99                                    19 The middle panels show the same variables for selected Asian countries. In real terms, the dollar has reversed much of its appreciation against the Thai baht and Korean won that occurred as the crisis spread in 1997. Most recently, those currencies have been fairly stable in nominal terms and inflation has been quite contained, developments that we expect will continue. We have incorporated into the forecast a stable Hong Kong dollar peg to the U.S. dollar, but some nominal appreciation of the dollar against the Chinese renminbi in 2000. With U.S. inflation generally above that in Hong Kong, the result is slight real dollar appreciation in both cases in our outlook. Asian stock market indexes are among the most euphoric and may be overstating how much progress has been made in addressing the structural problems laid bare by the crisis. In recent months, the foreign sector of the Chinese stock market (the black line) has risen particularly sharply. The three major Latin American countries are shown at the bottom. We are projecting that the Brazilian real will remain near current levels in nominal terms. With Brazilian inflation contained but above U.S. rates, the real should appreciate some in real terms, i.e. dollar depreciation. Controversy over the Argentine peso convertibility regime abounds. Proposals for dollarization are still actively discussed, yet there have been market rumors of ending the peg. With little firm basis to judge how this issue will be resolved, at least until the election in October, we continue to expect the peg to hold. In that event, with Argentine inflation expected to remain below U.S. rates, the dollar should rise slightly in real terms against the Argentine peso. The stock markets in Brazil and Mexico have shared in the optimism being expressed elsewhere. In Argentina, ongoing market concerns have restrained increases. Your next chart presents our outlook for foreign growth, with some details on the industrial countries. As is evident in the top left, we anticipate a convergence of U.S. real GDP growth with the average of that abroad in 2000. Our view that real output growth abroad should pick up this year is bolstered by the surprisingly robust first-quarter results that have been reported for some countries, including Japan. We see some of that strength as transitory, however, and so look for some offset in the current quarter and, in general, have not extrapolated even stronger growth performance into next year. As can be seen at the right, the lion's share of the improvement is expected to occur in developing Asia, with somewhat less acceleration in Latin America. Industrial country growth is projected to firm. In the middle left panel, the latest data on industrial production reflect the somewhat lackluster performance in Europe in recent quarters in 6/29-30/99                                   20 contrast to the vigor in Canada. The latest data for Japan show some improvement, but not enough to explain the 7.9 percent annual GDP growth in the first quarter that was recently announced. Our projection for sustained expansion in these countries rests in part on the accommodative monetary conditions that are visible in the middle right panel. Some improvement in business confidence, seen in the lower left panel, is another factor leading us in that direction. The Japanese Tankan report for the second quarter is due to be released shortly. A significant move in the positive direction is widely expected, especially in light of the fact the survey was taken shortly after the strong Q1 real GDP data were released. The top panels on Chart 9 document the recovery that is unfolding in the Asian crisis countries. Industrial production has been rebounding since the middle of last year, with production in Korea moving above its pre-crisis peak. Dollar interest rate spreads have moved back down, though not to the levels of early 1997. This narrowing reflects improved market confidence in these economies, but also the recognition that spreads before the crisis were too low. The recovery in the developing Asian countries remains vulnerable, and a major disruption elsewhere could renew pressures on them. Although we are expecting that China will experience sustained moderate growth and financial stability, developments in that country are one possible source of renewed volatility in Asia. The middle left panel highlights some external issues. The Chinese trade surplus (in black) has been shrinking since mid-1998. At first, a sharp drop-off in exports narrowed the trade balance; in recent months, exports have recovered somewhat but imports have surged. The higher rate of recorded imports may reflect anti-smuggling initiatives taken recently by the Chinese. The red line shows foreign direct investment in China. While there seem to be seasonally low inflows in the first quarter, the data for this year are below those for the first quarter in both 1997 and 1998. Foreign direct investment has tended to go into the export sector and to support investment in the non-state sector. The real depreciation of other Asian currencies has put pressure on the Chinese export sector and may weaken inward direct investment. The right panel illustrates the deflation that China has been experiencing, another symptom of the depressed demand within China. Industrial production bounced back in the second half of last year from some slowing earlier. The most recent months' data suggest that production continues to expand moderately; as a consequence, our forecast is for somewhat slower growth in China than has been the case in the past, but we are not looking for a deflationary spiral to become established. The lower left panel suggests some risks for the developing Asian economies. The emergence of recovery and the return of financial market confidence could undermine the momentum behind the reform process. In 6/29-30/99                                   21 Korea and other countries, where difficult issues of industrial relations and corporate governance need to be addressed, moderate growth may lessen the sense of urgency and the political will for reform. In many of these countries, banking sector problems continue and non-performing loans are still a large share of total bank loans. Moreover, the corporate sector needs resolution of these debts so that private investment can resume efficiently. In addition, weakness in the Chinese economy might spark political turmoil there and could derail recovery in Asia in general. The Latin American countries are featured on Chart 10. As you can see in the upper left, production in Mexico has largely withstood the spread of financial volatility to Latin America. In Brazil and especially Argentina that is not the case; production has been significantly reduced. For all three countries, the stripped spreads on dollar-denominated Brady bonds have moved back down following the previous spikes. The most recent segment of all three of those lines shows the backup in spreads that has occurred in response to uncertainties in Argentina about the government's fiscal program and the commitment to the peg of the currency to the U.S. dollar. Market nervousness was heightened by the announcement in May of your move to a tightening bias and the possible implications of a slower U.S. economy and higher dollar interest rates for Latin America. The middle left panel illustrates that improvement in the external balances of these countries has been limited despite currency adjustment in Brazil and Mexico and slower domestic demand. Continued dependence on capital inflows implies that these countries remain vulnerable to events that might disrupt global financial markets. Still, on balance, events in these countries have been more favorable than we were expecting in February. One bit of evidence is that Brazilian domestic interest rates have come down, without negative repercussions, as shown in the middle right panel. Lower domestic rates are critical in keeping the domestic debt in Brazil from swelling at an alarming rate. The surprisingly moderate response of inflation to the currency decline, shown by the red line, has been an important factor behind the decline in domestic interest rates. The immediacy with which market spreads reacted to disappointing news in Argentina suggests that the situation in Latin America remains fragile. If key financial variables shift abruptly, the forecast of moderate growth on average in the region could be derailed. The major risks appear to be those listed in the lower left panel. Some of the fiscal steps taken to date by Brazil were one-time measures. Evidence of significant forward progress on a permanent basis is lacking. If markets sense continued fiscal problems in Brazil, they will be quick to move rates, which in turn will exacerbate the fiscal problems. In Argentina, both domestic and 6/29-30/99                                  22 foreign investors are essential to the maintenance of the currency peg and to the financing of Argentina's external deficit. Despite some insurance that the government has taken out against financial contingencies, Argentina remains vulnerable to a loss of confidence. Elections this year in Argentina and next year in Mexico add to the markets' sensitivity to any indications of policy missteps by those governments. My final two charts focus on U.S. trade. The top panels of Chart 11 show exports and imports for selected trading partner regions. Exports to developing Asia stalled in 1997 and then declined; exports to Latin America followed suit a bit later. Exports to Europe and Canada have, on balance, grown in nominal terms, but not by much. In contrast, U.S. imports from these regions have been a source of expanding demand that has helped them to sustain expansions or mitigate declines of production. In the oil market, an agreement in March among producers to restrict supply and some evidence to date of compliance with that agreement have been successful in raising spot oil prices. We expect that U.S. oil import prices will follow this path, but that both those prices will move back slightly as some producers succumb to the temptation to increase output at the higher prices. Non-oil commodity prices fell sharply in 1998, in part in response to weaker global demand. As Mike noted, we do not expect that disinflationary element to be present going forward. The bottom two panels explain the elements of our forecast for core import prices--that is the prices of goods other than oil, semiconductors, and computers. We look for those prices, the red line, to move from showing small declines to showing small increases by the end of the year. Next year, core import prices should rise, but less than 2 percent for the year as a whole. This acceleration in import prices owes to the disappearance of the downward effect of global commodity prices, shown as the bars in the left panel, and to a shift from downward to upward pressure imparted by the combined effect of foreign prices and the exchange rate, the bars in the right panel. The top panels of Chart 12 decompose the elements of our forecast for the quantities of core exports (goods excluding agricultural products, semiconductors, and computers) and core imports (goods excluding oil, semiconductors, and computers). For exports, we look for foreign GDP growth to return to being a strong positive factor while the negative impact of past dollar appreciation wanes and ceases to be important. For imports, stimulus both from U.S. GDP growth and from relative prices (largely the exchange rate) lessens over the forecast period; accordingly, we see core import growth slowing to about 6 percent. 6/29-30/99                                    23 If all those pieces do fall into place, real net exports, the middle left panel, will continue to exert a negative influence on U.S. real GDP growth but to a diminishing extent. The nominal trade deficit will continue to widen, however. And despite a boost from some revisions to data for our investment position, and therefore some adjustments to estimates of flow income, the current account deficit will continue to expand, reaching some very large numbers. Relative to GDP, the current account balance is less startling, but we anticipate that during the current year it will breach the low reached in the late 1980s. If global recovery proceeds more or less along the lines we have suggested in the Greenbook, so that no new crisis elements command the attention of markets, then the rapid pace at which the U.S. external deficit is widening and the magnitudes that it is reaching may receive more attention. We revisited our slightly more aggregated model that simulates longer-term relationships. The continued strength of the dollar and the relative cyclical strength of the U.S. economy over the past two years have made the starting point of our analysis relatively unfavorable. Evidence that the potential rate of growth of the United States has increased recently, while that abroad has not, imparts an even greater sustained tendency for the U.S. external deficit to widen over time than conventionally accepted. The panels at the bottom of the chart show the current account relative to GDP, on the left, and the net international investment position relative to GDP, on the right. The baseline assumes that both in the United States and abroad, output returns in the near term to equal potential and then grows at potential rates thereafter. We have also incorporated some sustained real dollar depreciation into the baseline, 1 percent at an annual rate. Nevertheless, the baseline shows chronic widening of the current account and deterioration of the net investment position. Such an outcome implies the underlying variables are not mutually consistent and some adjustment in one or more of them would be needed. The parameters of this model, based on historical experience of the past two decades, suggest that, were the adjustment to come solely through the price competitiveness of U.S. goods, the real depreciation of the dollar would have to average 4 percent per year in order for these ratios to stabilize as shown by the red line. Alternatively, adjustment could come from income channels rather than price channels. If foreign industrial output were to move to a higher rate of potential growth, perhaps as a consequence of some of the factors that have increased productivity in the United States, and if U.S. imports were to shift over time to being less responsive to U.S. income growth, then the adjustment path shown by the blue line would result. Clearly, actual adjustment will likely entail both channels. These results suggest to us that greater market attention to the 6/29-30/99                                    24 path for U.S. external balances is likely although the timing of that attention is still uncertain. Mike will now complete our presentation. The final chart summarizes your forecasts. In short, the central tendencies--constructed here by dropping the high three and low three of the distributions for each variable--are closely in line with the staff's Greenbook numbers. Y2K effects are minimal. Perhaps more interesting--and potentially more relevant in light of the statutory requirement that the Humphrey-Hawkins report comment on the relationship of the Fed's monetary policy objectives to the Administration's forecast--is the comparison of your forecasts to those in the right-most column of the table, drawn from yesterday's Mid-session Review budget document. Your central tendencies are noticeably more optimistic about real GDP growth this year and next than they are, but little different with respect to CPI inflation. I'm not in a position to read your minds or those of the Administration forecasters. However, I'd note two things: First, it would appear that the Administration forecasters have anticipated no change in short-term rates, so monetary policy does not seem to be key to their slower growth forecast; second, although they've raised their assumption regarding trend productivity growth, at only 1.6 percent for nonfarm businesses it lies well below the 2 percent implicit in the Greenbook projection. Thank you very much. Questions for our colleagues? President Parry. Mike, I have a question about the Y2K effects. The quarterly impact of Y2K in the forecast is primarily an inventory effect. One gets the impression that there could be some effect--I don't know the size of it--that could work in an opposite direction in the sense that we hear of companies postponing projects. Many banks, for example, have delayed combining their data systems as they have merged, and I imagine there probably are examples in other industries. The assumption at least is that sometime in the year 2000, though perhaps not immediately, they are going to begin those projects--and not all of them are IT projects. Is there the potential for a significant reverse effect that we are not taking into account? We have taken account of three categories of effects here. One is a precautionary stockpiling, and we have a very modest amount of stockpiling occurring on the part of both households and businesses. Businesses in many cases will want to have 6/29-30/99                                    25 some extra supplies on hand beginning in 2000 just in case the normal supply channels are disrupted. The second element is some disruption. There will probably be, somewhere, some malfunctions--electrical outages or whatever--that disrupt some public services at the beginning of next year. But again, we made the assumption that those will be very minor and quickly resolved. The third set of considerations relates, I think, to the point you are raising. In our case, we focused it entirely on the computer area. We have assumed that the remarkable strength of computer purchases in 1998 and hefty purchases in the first part of this year reflect in part some speeding up of replacement cycles to replace non-compliant equipment. And we think there will be, at least in some firms, a lockdown of computer systems in the latter part of this year, a falloff in computer outlays, and probably a lot of scurrying around to get the last minute fixes done. So there may be some subtraction from productivity on that score. Next year there will probably still be some fixing up of glitches that are discovered early in the year. But as we move through the year, we would anticipate a rebound in computer outlays and perhaps associated investments as firms feel that they are in the clear and can go back to the normal strategies for their companies. We scaled all of these things, I think, pretty small. The computer swings are quite marked, but I think the inventory question is really quite open at this point. Our sense is that a lot of firms have not yet really settled their plans on how much they are going to stockpile. They are still in contact with their suppliers, trying to get assurances that there won't be problems and trying to assess where the risks may be. We anticipate that they will firm up those decisions over the next few months and, therefore, that most of the inventory building will occur in the latter months of this year. That is when the production effects will probably show up for the most part. Okay. President Minehan. I have a follow-up question to that. I know that the numbers work out right and all of that, but the thought of having a first quarter with no growth that seems to be driven to a large extent by a Y2K inventory swing just doesn't feel right. I recognize that we are going into a period of slowing growth around that time, so some portion of the slowing reflects that. But to go from growth of something like 3.9 percent 6/29-30/99                                   26 in Q4 1999 to something close to zero in the first quarter of next year just doesn't square with all the information that we have been gathering about where people are with Y2K. We had a session on Y2K issues with a wide range of industries on Friday and we invited the media. We had representatives from the electrical and telephone industries, from supermarkets, police departments, and banks. We had the FAA there, too. The theme was exactly the same in every single industry: Somewhere between 85 and 95 percent of their systems are Y2K compliant, ready to go just as ours are. And there is a lot of near-term focus on both contingency plans and outreach. We had no trouble getting the key people to come in and talk. We populated the audience with media people, including some from cable television. I have seen television programs about Y2K on the local cable stations almost ad nauseam since then. There is a lot of desire on the part of these industries to get out the message that they are ready. We've seen some Gallup poll surveys that tell us the more people know about the banking situation and so forth the less they are likely to do strange things or think about doing strange things at year-end. So I am wondering whether--as cautious as I know you have been and as accurate as I know the numbers are--we are really going to see that kind of swing over that short a period of time as a consequence of Y2K. I would just reiterate the thought that we have really very small effects built in here. When they are annualized, they whip these numbers around. In the recent NAPM survey at midyear, one of the questions asked of the purchasing managers was what they might do. We tried to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on those numbers. And I can tell you from just looking at that, in manufacturing materials it is a multiple of the inventory effects we have built in here. If people begin to get a little panicked--if they get stirred up by the end-of-the-world TV programs or articles that undoubtedly will be offered in the closing months of this year--the $25 worth of precautionary expenditures per household that we built into this forecast will be a fraction of what will occur. Now, some of this will just mean that stocks will run down in some places because firms will not have produced enough to accommodate that demand, so it will all come out in the wash here. But I think the potential is for even bigger swings than this. 6/29-30/99                                   27 It may be that people will be sufficiently reassured only to take a few hundred dollars out of their bank account, but that's symbolic of the kind of concerns that will lead people to do some other things as well. I guess I'm somewhat conditioned by my experience here in Washington, D.C. when there is the slightest hint of a possible snowstorm and people buy six months' worth of toilet paper. People do get carried away at times. And for a purchasing manager, the cost of ending up with a few extra materials on the shelf that can be used up in the first weeks or months of 2000 is not very high as opposed to being short in what is needed to keep the production lines running. So we are highlighting something that potentially could make for a considerable amount of noise in the data. In terms of your numbers and what we would be presenting to the Congress in the Humphrey- Hawkins report, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis the effects are so small as to be trivial. So I don't think there is cause to make any big to-do about this other than to highlight the bit of uncertainty that exists about what might occur at the end of the year. I have one question on a different subject. On your Chart 4 on financial fragility, when we measure debt levels against either the value of household financial assets or household net worth or we look at corporate debt relative to measures that incorporate the value of the stock market, are we kidding ourselves to some extent? Shouldn't we be looking at it against something that doesn't take into account the value of assets that, when they decline, might tend to weaken the positions that we think are strong only because equity assets are so overvalued? I think there is much to be said for that point, and that is why I focused on the ratios I have here. I focused in these Survey of Consumer Finance runs on proportions of payments to income, thinking that that represents people's ongoing cash flows. As I noted, for shareholders that may include some realized capital gains. But even if the market goes down, I suspect some people in their panic might realize some capital gains, so they will get some cash from that in some instances. But hasn't corporate debt as a percentage of GDP gotten fairly sizable these days? As a percent of GDP, sure. In the recent period, corporate debt has been rising relatively rapidly. Again, it's a question of what balance sheet ratios one wants to look at. Many firms have a good deal of cash right now, so I don't think the 6/29-30/99                                    28 corporate balance sheet picture looks particularly troublesome. And I don't think the behavior of the rating agencies suggests that there has been any clear deterioration. That certainly has not happened. President Poole. On the Y2K issue, I don't think there is any potentially important event since I have been an economist about which we have less professional basis for speculating. [Laughter] I really don't. It seems to me that the role for us here is to ensure that the things we say try to minimize the impact of this event. The kind of thing we should say is that, based on everything we know about all the preparations that we and everybody else have made, there is no reason for any rational consumer or any rational business to do anything that is going to show up in the aggregate data. Go for it, Bill! That is what I think we could offer as economists. As for trying to speculate about things on which we have no professional knowledge, I just don't know what to say about them. Further questions or comments? Karen, on your chart 12 entitled \\\"U.S. Current Account to GDP Ratio\\\" what assumptions do you have for your baseline? How did you get the baseline? The baseline starts with the Greenbook forecast and the initial extension that is sort of implicit in the Bluebook. In the Bluebook, okay. The baseline brings growth in activity abroad and in the United States back to potential and then holds it at potential. That is of critical importance to this particular model because the minute we decide what that growth rate is going to be and multiply it times elasticities, we've answered a lot of the questions about what is going to happen to trade. The elasticities are given so that there is no scope within this model for any type of feedback between the factors that might be driving demographics or driving savings and investments to change the propensities to import and to export. But we did in the blue line sort of exogenously adjust those to see what would happen if we thought there were reasons to believe that they might move back in a favorable direction. We were addressing the questions of \\\"how much would that have to be?\\\" and \\\"what would it 6/29-30/99                                   29 look like if it happened?\\\" But otherwise it's our best guess of what potential is in the different countries that we modeled, plus the Bluebook assumptions with respect to the United States and a 1 percent real appreciation of the dollar. Embedded in that also are some assumptions about interest rates and the like that have to be there to flesh out the current account. Refresh my memory, what is the import elasticity used in the baseline? For the United States it is approximately 2. Thank you. I had not seen the Administration forecast shown here. Is this the growth forecast in the recent budget estimates that just came out in the newspapers that added something like a trillion dollars to the surplus over a 10-year period? Given the size of their addition to the surplus, their estimate of growth is very, very modest. So by the FOMC's standards even that would be an underestimate, right? Does all that follow? That's what I was suggesting. These are the numbers from the Mid-session Review that was published yesterday. They have characterized it as being in line with the Blue Chip forecast and conservative. In point of fact it is quite a bit below the Blue Chip. I don't know what the longer-term numbers they might have from the Blue Chip forecast look like. But I must say that they have tended to err on the low side, I think publicly and purposely in their process, which makes some sense if they are trying to be cautious about counting revenues. On the other hand, it may skew a fiscal policy decision by suggesting that things are tighter than the numbers might otherwise have indicated. There is clearly a political element in that decision. They were on the low side in February, too, you know. Yes, they've tended to be very, very low. One has to be a little careful about translating that growth forecast into the surplus numbers because the so-called technical adjustments are overwhelmingly important. It is quite possible--I don't know if this is true, I'm just saying it's a possibility--that their GDP forecast can come in low and they overwhelm it 6/29-30/99                                   30 by technical adjustments that would create a big surplus. So, we have to look at the detail. In fact, what little insight we have would suggest that their surplus numbers look on the low side relative to ours in part because they put in higher expenditure numbers than seem to be in train at this point, as opposed to it being simply the difference in our economic assumptions. But they are making very significant projections into the future. Sure. Fortunately, we have not gotten into 15-year budget forecasting yet. I hope you don't have to bite your tongue! [Laughter] President Stern. Karen, I would like to go back to the baseline forecast on the bottom of Chart 12 that Tom Hoenig mentioned. As I understand it, in those baseline numbers you have the dollar depreciating mildly in real terms. If I understood Peter's litany of things that might come back to haunt us--having to do especially with the euro and the yen--they seem to imply that the euro and the yen might both depreciate relative to the dollar once market perceptions change. That is, the attitude right now may be that the Japanese are succeeding in stabilizing the yen, but we don't expect that to last. If that is right, these numbers would look even worse, presumably. Well, the model that is embedded in these two charts was put together by the International Finance Division two years ago. And it came to somewhat less fearsome conclusions because the dollar is two years' worth of appreciation lower now and we have not had two years of full-blown U.S. deficits piling up and so forth. We said the same thing then, and in fact the world went completely the opposite way. Even though we said then that the current account would begin to get alarming and the projections were inevitable, the numbers have gone in the other direction for two years. So there is no sense in which I mean this chart to be telling you what is going to happen starting tomorrow. No, I understand that. That's fine. 6/29-30/99                                   31 I'm only flagging the problem that is out there, which is that to the extent Japan's economy turns down, there is some possibility that markets may react negatively once the dust is all settled and what is really going on is clear. And if Japan continues to drag its feet about some of the more important policy adjustments, we could indeed see yet more years in which the problem in fact gets worse before it gets better. If I could just clarify my comments, in the short run I am more worried about a rapid yen appreciation such as the one we had in 1997-98--that kind of episode that they're currently bottling up. That's not a forecast of where it will all come out in the wash once the Japanese economy settles down. But it's the oscillation of the portfolio effect in and out of the Japanese financial sector--rushing out, rushing in--that could give us a burst. That's what they are resisting now, they think. So there's just more volatility there in the short run. In the long run I wouldn't stake my bets there. The weak euro/strong yen is the short-run scenario. Any further questions? If not, why don't we take a short break for coffee. [Coffee break] Would somebody like to begin the round table discussion? President Parry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid pace in recent months, with growth accelerating from earlier in the year. District payrolls increased at an average annual rate of 3 percent during April and May, as rapid growth in some states more than offset a slight slowing in others. The acceleration was dominated by California, where payrolls expanded at a 3 percent average annual pace in April and May, well above the 2 percent pace of the first quarter. Payrolls also grew rapidly in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. In Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington employment growth slowed in recent months, falling below the national pace of growth. The construction and services sectors continue to be the strongest sectors of the District economy. Employment growth in construction was particularly rapid, up by 10 percent at an annual rate during the two months ended in May. The rate in the services sector was 5 percent. District manufacturing payrolls have declined slowly in 1999, although employment has stabilized in recent months. Increased demand for 6/29-30/99                                     32 computers, consumer electronics, and telecommunication products, as well as the resurgence of many economies in Asia, are boosting sales and orders throughout the high-tech manufacturing sector. Although improved market conditions have yet to generate significant job growth among District high-tech manufacturers, employment levels have stabilized and output is rising. Thus far, productivity gains and increases in the average workweek have allowed many high-tech manufacturers to meet production goals without boosting employment. However, these firms will likely need to increase employment in the near future since they anticipate an acceleration in the growth of sales and orders and most have absorbed what had been excess capacity in their existing employment bases. Turning to the national outlook, data since the last meeting have done little to change our perception of the basic forces shaping the economy. In our forecast, demand is expected to remain strong in the near term, allowing real output growth to average more than 3 percent over the remainder of this year. However, recent increases in interest rates combined with an expected flattening of the stock market should start restraining demands toward the end of the year. Consequently, we expect real output growth to slow to about 2 percent next year. Recent high levels of demand have not translated into high inflation because of the favorable developments on the supply side. Consequently, core CPI stands roughly unchanged in our forecast. However, as I mentioned last time, the recent history of forecast errors makes it hard to be very confident about any forecast of this split between output growth and inflation. Because there is no way to determine the size or persistence of the current supply shock at this point in time, it is really hard to tell how fast the economy can grow without inflationary pressures. Forecasts that utilize the level of the output gap can be quite misleading, as illustrated by the staff papers distributed by Don Kohn. This uncertainty suggests placing more emphasis on nominal GDP growth, which tends to internalize offsetting movements in inflation and output growth. And its use as an indicator can be similar to the way we used the monetary aggregates in the past. In this framework, the small deceleration in annual spending growth over the last three years to a rate around 5 percent helps me to be more reasonably optimistic about inflation. However, I am not completely comfortable 6/29-30/99                                    33 with recent developments, as nominal GDP has grown at a 6 percent rate over the last two quarters. Thus, I will be watching the spending numbers carefully to determine whether this is a one-time event or the beginning of a sustained increase in nominal spending. Thank you. President Hoenig. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Kansas City District's economy remains quite solid, as I reported last time. Retail sales are well above year-ago levels. Real estate sales and construction activity remain quite healthy. Manufacturing activity actually shows some further signs of improving, following an earlier period of weakness. Factory managers are reporting to us that capacity utilization is up considerably from earlier months this year and nearly back to year-ago levels. Energy activity has continued to improve in June according to our producers in the region. The farm economy remains in a deep slump, and I would say that we are hearing increasing reports from rural America that the farm downturn is beginning to hurt Main Street and that we are going to see some repercussions on the banks. Having said that, the labor market in our District remains extremely tight. The District's unemployment rate edged down to about 3 percent this past month. And there is now some additional anecdotal evidence that persistently tight labor markets are limiting growth in some District areas. Just as one example, American West announced it will move 180 jobs from the Kansas City area because it cannot find people to fill the jobs there. Now, where they are going to move them to isn't all that clear, but certainly they can't fill the jobs in the Kansas City area. Turning to the national scene, I continue to expect the trend in economic activity to moderate by the end of next year. For now, though, I foresee another year of strong economic activity, with real GDP growing on average about 4 percent this year and slowing to an average of just above 3 percent next year. As for my views on the inflation outlook, I would note a couple of points. Similar to what Bob Parry just said, my stronger forecast represents yet another upward revision in the outlook. I notice in the consensus forecast that others share that view. I continue to be impressed by the momentum of the U.S. economy as we make these adjustments, 6/29-30/99                                      34 and I also continue to be impressed by the fact that the inflation numbers are still coming in at a modest level. Having said that, I still judge that the risks on the inflation outlook are on the upside. First of all, as I have said before, the funds rate is 75 basis points less than it was a year ago when the economy was already expanding at a fairly good pace. Since then, the financial turmoil that occurred last fall has largely subsided, risk spreads are in fact lower, and growth is projected to remain strong. So in that context, I think the stance of monetary policy is accommodative. When one looks at M2 growth, while it has slowed most recently, it remains relatively strong--increasing by about 8 percent over year-ago levels. And as others have noted in a different context, there are some signs that inflation expectations are rising. The inflation premium embedded in the Treasury inflation- protected securities has been rising since last fall. So, while recognizing that inflation is modest, I believe there is some upside inflationary risk in the context of this very strong economy right now. President Moskow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Business conditions in the Seventh District remain quite good. Light motor vehicle sales in May matched their 12-year high reached last December, and industry contacts suggest that June sales will exceed the strong year-to-date sales pace of 16.4 million units. Net orders for medium and heavy- duty trucks continue to run above long-run averages. Commercial construction activity in Chicago has gained momentum in recent months but with few signs of speculative activity. Lenders and investors are requiring that 50 percent of office space be pre-leased, and that is one reason some previously announced projects are not making it off the drafter's table. More generally, our manufacturing sector is still performing well. For example, the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey results for June show the overall index moving further above the 50 percent level, from 57.9 percent in May to 60 percent in June. That survey is going to be released to the public tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Even the steel industry reports a bit of improvement, as capacity utilization rates have risen noticeably over the past few months, although they remain significantly below typical operating levels. 6/29-30/99                                   35 Moreover, as Tom Hoenig just mentioned, conditions in the ag sector generally remain depressed, with no significant improvement likely for some time even with improving conditions abroad. Nonetheless, our District labor markets are still extremely tight. We spoke with contacts at two national temporary service firms headquartered in our District and both reported continued difficulty in finding workers to satisfy clients' demands. One contact even said that he had shifted all of his marketing expenditures to finding workers and none to finding clients. Both firms also indicated that we have passed the peak for Y2K-related hiring of technical personnel. On the price side, we increasingly hear reports of price increases that stick, both for final and intermediate goods. Auto dealers and some casual dining establishments have been able to raise prices modestly, and a few retailers indicated that strong sales results were not as dependent on promotional activity as before. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Report for June again indicated that relatively more respondents were experiencing increases in prices paid than declines. The prices paid component, seasonally adjusted, went from 52.5 percent in May to 57.2 percent in June. That is the fourth consecutive month above 50 percent, and it is the highest since December of 1997. Before turning to our national outlook, I'd like to summarize some recent discussions about productivity that we had at our Bank. At our most recent board of directors meeting, which the Chairman attended, we heard some very optimistic assessments of the prospects for e-commerce to increase productivity in several sectors of the economy. Our directors reported on how advances in computer technology have affected their particular companies and industries--manufacturing, retailing, banking and services in particular--and on the potential for these technological advances to fundamentally change the nature of our economy. The reports consistently noted that technology has enhanced productivity pretty much across the board and that its potential to yield further productivity improvements seems limitless. On the other hand, at our Academic Advisory Council meeting one participant presented a paper suggesting that the recent pickup in productivity growth is due only to: (1) measurement changes; (2) the normal cyclical response of productivity; and (3) acceleration of productivity growth in the computer industry itself--not in industries using computers but in the information processing and equipment sector alone. The analysis 6/29-30/99                                    36 suggests that productivity gains in the computer manufacturing sector have not spilled over to the rest of the economy, at least in the data, casting some doubt on how widespread productivity increases have been. Obviously, productivity growth is a key issue confronting us today. Turning to the national outlook, our views are reasonably similar to those in the Greenbook. Our forecast for core CPI inflation is, however, a couple of tenths higher for next year. More importantly, even with a tightening in policy similar to that assumed in the Greenbook, we see further acceleration in inflation in 2001. So the upside risks remain substantial. The downside risks, on the other hand, are considerably less than those we faced when we last adjusted policy. Most of the news on the world economy is suggesting more strength than previously expected. Moreover, risk spreads, while still somewhat elevated, are back to more reasonable levels, and creditworthy borrowers are finding financing. Meanwhile, the same factors that have been propelling the rapid expansion of domestic demand--high income growth, high wealth levels, and high consumer confidence--remain in place. So it seems to me that it's the time to begin the process of tightening policy. President Minehan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The New England economy remains strong, with tight labor markets reportedly constraining business growth, and strong residential and commercial real estate markets, particularly in the Boston metropolitan area. In the words of one of the Bank's directors, Boston is \\\"absolutely booming,\\\" though this description likely does not apply equally to all cities in the District. In May, the total number of people employed in the region fell a bit from its April level, but employment continues to expand at a pace that is higher than its long-term trend. The unemployment rate remains well below the nation's, although it has bounced around a bit in some states and ended slightly higher in May than in April. After virtually no growth in 1998, the region's labor force in 1999 is growing in every state except Massachusetts. Given all the stories one hears about hard-to-find labor, however, one has to believe that these new entrants to the labor force do not have the skills for the jobs being created. 6/29-30/99                                    37 All of the Bank's contacts recently have complained that hiring difficulties are constraining growth. Technical staff have been hard to come by for some time, but job vacancies seem to abound in every service and retail establishment. The job market for summer teenage employment is strikingly good if my 17-year old and his friends are any indication of that market. All of them don't have minimum-wage jobs as compared with the experience of my daughter and her friends a couple of years ago. In fact, my son is now making $9 an hour for selling CDs, which he would probably do for free. [Laughter] Moreover, we hear stories--and I know of actual examples--of temporary help firms reaching out to teenagers who have keyboard skills and offering them $12 to $14 per hour to fill the vacancies the firms have during the summer. Our contacts with temporary help firms more generally, like President Moskow's, see business as good to great, but with revenues constrained by a lack of workers. IT staff are hardest to come by, as has been the case for a while. Some temporary help firms have broadened their base of workers to light industrial staff simply because there is a better supply of low- wage workers; according to one contact, even former welfare recipients are getting lucrative offers now. Amazingly, wage and price increases continue to be moderate. Inflation as measured by the CPI abated slightly in the Boston metropolitan area in recent months, largely due to a more sizable decline in fuel costs locally than nationally. Wages in manufacturing and retail are reported to be growing in the range of 3 to 5 percent this year, even given the dearth of supply. Firms report that changes in organizational structure and in non-wage job enhancements such as training are being pursued in favor of wage increases. Residential real estate prices for the region grew faster than for the nation as a whole, and commercial real estate conditions are strong in several metropolitan areas. Until quite recently, Boston enjoyed the lowest Class A office space vacancy rate in the country and very low rates for Class B space as well. Rents for commercial space continue to rise and now exceed those in both New York and San Francisco. While high rates obviously mean profits for Boston building owners, they could also deter new or expanding businesses from locating in Boston. Indeed, the latest data show downtown vacancy rates have doubled from their extremely low level, though they continue to be 6/29-30/99                                    38 below the national average. Assuming these data are not an aberration, there may be some evidence of a cooling of demand at current price levels. Turning to the national scene, our forecast--like those of others--is similar to the Greenbook forecast. Economic activity is projected to slow this year and next as a result of moderating growth in consumption due to buyer satiation and a waning wealth effect from leveling stock market prices. Business investment also slows in our forecast, especially for computers, and net exports exert a continuing though smaller drag. Actually, in our forecast the growth in exports turns moderately positive this year, given expectations about growth in foreign countries. In our view GDP growth in 1999, Q4 over Q4, will be about 3 percent, not unlike the Greenbook, and will then decline to the high 2 percent area in 2000. We, like the Board staff, have now provided for a slightly higher growth potential for the economy at about 2 percent, at least for a period of time. And in our view, growth in 2000 will slow to about that level and thus unemployment will stay roughly flat. However, without a policy change, our forecast suggests that core inflation could rise in 2000--as does the Greenbook forecast--but the increase is larger and takes core price inflation to around 3 percent, which is clearly unacceptable in my view. Now, there is no doubt that this forecast is surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty. Certainly all the papers we have received since the last meeting have pointed to the various sources of that uncertainty and the reasons to be agnostic about projections of both output gaps and inflationary growth. Indeed, when I look at our track record at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the track record of the Committee in general, we have been underestimating growth and overestimating inflation for some period of time. Perhaps our assessment of a positive output gap is wrong and later data will provide ample evidence of why we've been seeing such low inflation. But perhaps later data will confirm both our current assessment and our concern that temporary factors have played a large role in the current run of economic good fortune. The effect of some of these temporary factors is clearly waning. In particular, estimates of trade-weighted external growth are rising for both 1999 and 2000, which should affect both the demand for U.S. exports and the supply of excess capacity worldwide. Absent tighter policy, financial imbalances now evidenced in high stock market PE ratios and in the sizable 6/29-30/99                                   39 growth in corporate and personal debt, even though it's affordable, may well deepen and pose threats when policy does tighten or a slowdown occurs as a result of other factors. Clearly, there are risks on the downside--the external deficit and the related low saving rate, just to name a couple. But the upside risks of increased pressure on capacity from worldwide growth and the potential for growing financial imbalances now seem both greater and more pressing. President Broaddus. For the sake of variety, let me reverse the usual order of my regional comments and tell you that not everything is great in our District. We have two problem sectors: agriculture and textiles. Agricultural and farm prices remain low for the most part, as does farm income. That situation has been exacerbated most recently by a drought; we have had very little rainfall. With respect to textiles, we continue to hear reports of plant closings in Virginia and the Carolinas; most of the business is going to Mexico. These closings depress the areas where these plants are located--and especially in those three states that's usually small towns--even though many laid-off textile workers are able to find alternative employment in the currently very tight labor market. Outside of these two sectors, though, it's generally the same old story around our region: robust consumer spending and housing activity, a revival in many manufacturing industries, and continued exceptionally tight labor markets pretty much across the board. According to the information we have--both anecdotal and a few hard numbers- consumer spending may actually have accelerated in our region in May and June. Car sales and sales of appliances and other housing-related durable goods have been particularly strong. A lot of that hefty household spending obviously is coming from consumer borrowing. Some of our banking directors tell us that delinquencies are rising and that they are seeing, and are more concerned about, consumer bankruptcies. So there are some hints of imbalances in the market for consumer credit, at least in our area. But the most significant imbalance that we have in our region clearly is still in labor markets, especially for skilled and semi-skilled construction workers. Shortages of these workers are widespread now, despite a fairly significant influx of guest workers from Canada and especially Mexico into the Carolinas and Virginias. Some builders tell us that they are actually turning away business because of this dearth of workers. 6/29-30/99                                   40 Beyond skilled construction workers, many businesses tell us that it's increasingly hard to find reasonably competent entry-level workers for just about any business. We're told that some McDonald's stores are now stuffing employment applications in the bag with the burger and fries. We hear the same stories that Michael Moskow and Cathy Minehan mentioned about the temp agencies. They have to scrape the barrel and it's hard to find anything resembling quality workers. Not surprisingly in this environment, we hear an increasing number of anecdotal reports about more aggressive wage demands than we've seen heretofore and some actual increases in wages in particular industries and local areas. I have a brief report about the First District for you, Cathy. One of our economists has a close friend who has a house in the Boston area. The friend got an estimate last year for an addition to his house but didn't have the work done. He got an estimate again just recently, a year later, and it's up about 30 percent. That's really extraordinary! On the national economy, I'll be brief. I don't have any special insights on the outlook at this point. I was very pleased to see the May CPI report. Obviously, the April CPI really scared me; if we had gotten a repeat of that in May, I would have been concerned that we were behind the curve. I suspect a lot of other people would have been concerned as well. So the May report was a relief, but I don't think we're out of danger yet. The Greenbook is projecting a fairly sizable deceleration in the growth of domestic demand in the second quarter now ending and in the third quarter. I think the staff makes a good case for this; I, too, expect some deceleration in demand. Heaven knows, I hope we get some deceleration! But, frankly, I just don't see much hard evidence of it yet; certainly I don't see it in my region. What I see is continued robust household demand for goods, services, and housing, big increases in our trade deficits, and help wanted signs all over the place. In short, we seem to have a fairly significant overall macroeconomic imbalance currently. More specifically, I think we have a classic case of excessive growth in domestic demand. I'm worried that we may well be fueling that with an excessively accommodative monetary policy. Thank you. President Guynn. 6/29-30/99                                    41 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As is usually the case, conditions in our region have changed only at the margin between meetings. Retail sales remain quite healthy. A number of retailers are actually telling us that they expect the third quarter to be as good as or even better than the second quarter. As I've noted before, tourism is a particularly interesting part of our economy and an area where we often get early signals of a turn in activity or of people's outlooks. In the tourism industry bookings remain strong; they are not growing quite as fast as they were a year ago but are still at very high levels. This is the first time in a while in our surveys of the District's tourism people that we haven't heard grumbling about the falloff in visitors from Latin American, Canada, or Europe. There is a growing sense that there may have been some overbuilding in new tourist attractions in the Orlando area. If you haven't been in the area for a while, come on down! [Laughter] Construction is still at high levels. We are seeing some slowing in the rate of growth in single family permits, but that's offset by quite strong nonresidential construction. We've recently heard new concerns about overbuilding in commercial projects in Orlando. In oil and gas, the higher oil prices that have prevailed for a while now have shown through in a modest uptick in drilling activity after a long period of decline. That should pick up further if oil prices continue to hold at their current levels. Our manufacturing activity, as measured by employment growth, may be a bit less robust than for other District reports included in the Beigebook. Our import- sensitive industries like apparel, paper, and primary metals have seen declines. At the same time, there's an optimism that we will begin to see, or may already be seeing, some turnaround as the economies of our trading partners begin to improve. An old story: Labor markets are still tight, and outsized wage increases are still being reported, mostly in certain high-skilled jobs. A recent example of noticeably large increases was at Ingalls Shipyard, where a three-year contract provides for a 16.3 percent increase. Pricing pressures seem to have increased a bit at the margin since the last meeting. As one our directors put it, many of the business people she talks to are increasingly determined to pass on their cost increases. Health care is a good example in our region. It's an area where pressures are great and where we are seeing some relatively large upward price adjustments.                                 who is a major 6/29-30/99                                    42 homebuilder in the region, also reports that he has been able to pass through many of the cost increases that he's seen in the building trades. On the national front, real GDP growth is still outpacing my expectations. Other than the effects of oil and energy costs, measured inflation is not yet showing the upward drift I thought we might see by now. Nevertheless, there have been some marginal changes to the outlook in my view, suggesting our assessment that the inflation risks are on the upside was in fact correct. Our GDP projections for most of the recently depressed Latin American and developing Asian economies have been revised upward. While the turnarounds have not yet been reflected in increases in U.S. exports and commodity prices or in capital markets, we expect that the demands for and prices of real goods and services and productive inputs will rise. This should reverse many of the favorable shocks that have slowed U.S. real GDP growth and temporarily reduced the rate of increase in prices. Furthermore, I see little on the domestic side to suggest that there will be a significant slowing in domestic demand during the rest of this year. Employment remains strong and consumer income and spending are up. Business investment spending may slow some, but it appears likely to continue to run ahead of past experience in a mature expansion. Should the reversal of the positive external shocks occur as expected, that raises a fundamental question about the overall stance of monetary policy. Would the associated run-up in measured inflation reflect embedded inflation that has been temporarily masked by a series of favorable events? Or would the increase be temporary due to the nature of the fixed-weight inflation measures and the fact that only relative prices of energy and commodities have increased? In general, relative price movements aren't inherently inflationary and they should be permitted to play themselves out. Such price pressures would dissipate quickly as real and financial resources are reallocated, as long as our policy stance prevents these relative price adjustments from being passed on through the economy as a general price level adjustment. However, if we persist in maintaining interest rates below what I believe is likely to be their pre-shock equilibrium levels, we may inadvertently be pursuing an easier and inherently inflationary monetary policy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 6/29-30/99                                    43 President Stern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The District economy continues to perform very well. Indicative of this, the unemployment rate in the Twin Cities metropolitan area is now 1.6 percent. Actually, it has been at that level for several months, so I don't believe it's an aberration. Estimates of the District unemployment rate are harder to come by, but that rate is probably 3 percent or lower. Residential construction activity is very strong. This probably will be a record year for both homebuilding and sales in the Twin Cities area. Commercial construction is also strong. Some of the national developers based in the Twin Cities tell us they are seeing good business basically throughout the country. Consumer spending remains healthy, tourism is doing fine, and manufacturing for the most part is doing fine. Agriculture remains the blight on the landscape. As far as the national economy is concerned, not surprisingly our VAR model remains quite optimistic. My own view is similar. I might briefly comment on where I think the risks don't lie. I don't think there is a risk of a precipitous slowing of domestic aggregate demand; that seems very unlikely to me. The risks abroad relative to what we thought six months or more ago clearly have diminished; indeed, we've already talked today both about better performance materializing abroad and forecasts for economies abroad being marked up. So I think in this environment we can concentrate on sustaining the economic expansion by keeping inflation low. President Boehne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The economy in the Philadelphia region continues to grow steadily, with tight labor markets and low inflation. The outlook is for more of the same. Residential construction is strong, with prices rising especially for upscale housing. Nonresidential construction is brisk but not booming. Manufacturers report further gains and retailers are generally doing well. Hiring and retaining skilled employees remain the major challenge. Although there are special incentives for particular skills, the norm for annual wage increases is still mostly in the 3 to 4 percent range and increases for unionized employees tend to fall in that range as well. 6/29-30/99                                   44 Turning to the nation, we are at the point in this remarkable expansion when the risk of accelerating inflation has to be taken seriously. Raising the federal funds rate as insurance against an overheating economy is largely a foregone conclusion at this meeting. The more important issue now is how to position ourselves going forward. Credibly resisting inflation also means being a credible evaluator of the inflation threat. To use an analogy, we need to be able to tell the difference between a wolf and the family dog. Let's be honest with ourselves: Current and pipeline indicators of inflation look more like the family dog than a wolf, and our forecasting models have for several years cried wolf when there has been no wolf. How well will a preemptive rationale for raising the funds rate hold up with that kind of support? Going forward we need to position ourselves so that we can evaluate the inflation risks on an ongoing basis and adjust monetary policy accordingly rather than box ourselves in unnecessarily. President McTeer. The pace of economic growth in the Eleventh District has slowed somewhat in the last few months. Slower activity has been concentrated in three areas: construction, energy, and exports, particularly exports to Mexico. Concerns about overbuilding have surfaced recently, and construction activity of all types, both residential and commercial, has dipped. Energy companies are behaving as though current levels of oil and gas prices are not sustainable. Their slowness to boost the rig count is probably driven in part by concerns about OPEC's ability to restrain output. Most OPEC member countries and others have not cut production to the full extent of their agreement, and fiscal pressures may necessitate increased output, particularly by Venezuela. Mexico seems to be having second thoughts about agreeing to restrain its oil output. Mexico's difficult fiscal situation has reduced its ability to raise spending on public works, a practice that is common in the year prior to a presidential election. Next year's election is expected to be close, so the incentive to augment revenues from higher oil production increases every day. Future oil prices will be determined by a race between increased OPEC and Mexican cheating on output quotas and the growth of world demand. Given the history of OPEC's output production agreements, Texas oil producers have good reason to remain cautious. 6/29-30/99                                    45 Turning to the national scene and focusing on issues that are relevant to the policy decision, I think what I'm going to do today is cry \\\"dog.\\\" [Laughter] Referring to Ed Boehne's foregone conclusion about what we are going to do tomorrow, what worries me about that is that we may trigger an end to the grand experiment that we've been engaged in without seeing how far it could go. We held back while output surged and unemployment declined to below levels previously thought inflationary, but inflation declined instead. And we've been rewarded with the lowest misery index in history. If we end this experiment, whether we intend to or not, we will never know how far it could have gone. What has changed? We had the April CPI report. But what about the May report? The twelve-month CPI, the headline number, has risen to converge with the core rate, but the change over that twelve-month period was driven more by dropping off the first month of the period than it was by anything that's happened more recently. We're rightly worried about accelerating inflation, but we're still in a deflationary world environment. We still haven't seen the end of the effects of the collapse of the iron curtain--all the new consumers and workers entering the world economy for the first time. Beyond the iron curtain, we've had the collapse of the curtain of protectionism in Latin America. We've had globalization in general. We've had the Internet and the convergence of technology. These are all deflationary forces. On the issue of a preemptive move, we had preemption redemption in 1994, so why not now? What's different now? In 1994 we had inflation in the pipeline. Sensitive commodity prices were rising rapidly throughout that year. Now they aren't rising. They are barely off their multiyear lows. Another important difference between 1994 and 1999 is that we began 1994 with the pedal to the metal. We had 3 percent nominal short-term interest rates and about 3 percent inflation, yielding real short-term interest rates of zero. Now we have a 4 percent federal funds rate and 2 percent inflation--or less by some measures. So we have real short-term interest rates of about 3 percent now and maybe 4 percent real long-term interest rates. Asia has perhaps started to heal, which will remove a deflationary force on our own economy. But, remember, commodity prices were falling before the Asia crisis. Developments in Asia and Russia just accelerated the 6/29-30/99                                      46 decline. The bulk of our price improvement in recent years came from lower import prices due to the strong dollar, but the dollar is still pretty strong. On the question of slack in our economy, the low unemployment rate suggests that we have little or none. But the low capacity utilization rate, under 80 percent, suggests otherwise. And our economists tell me that capacity utilization is a better predictor of future inflation than unemployment. We should not forget the slack elsewhere in the global economy: Asia still has slack, both in labor and manufacturing capacity; Europe is weak and sluggish; and much of Latin America is still in recession. If it's real growth we're worried about, I for one believe that rapid supply side technology-driven real growth is disinflationary, not inflationary. But if you're a strict demand sider, take heart from the Dallas Fed's recent forecast of real growth in the second quarter. Our forecast was, believe it or not, 2.9 percent, and that was before our staff saw the Greenbook. We're really good at forecasting backwards! [Laughter] With labor productivity growing an average 4 percent over the fourth quarter and the first quarter, it could decline by half and still be 2 percent. Add on a 1 percent increase in labor supply and that would give us noninflationary 3 percent growth for some time to come. Turning to Peter Fisher's fourth point a while ago, I think the biggest argument for tightening at this meeting is that so many of us have threatened it that the Committee would probably lose face and lose credibility if it didn't raise the funds rate by at least point. But even then, if we kept the asymmetric directive, I think the markets would remain nervous and turbulent over the next Fed-watch period. If I had the deciding vote, I probably would vote for a small tightening just because of the box we're in. But since I won't have the deciding vote or even a key vote, I remain to be convinced. Vice Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Second District's economy remains strong, though growth has clearly slowed from its brisk first- quarter pace. There are no indications of broad-based price pressures. Employment in the District grew at a 1 percent annual rate in April and May, matching the first- quarter pace but down from 2 percent in 1998. Retailers report that sales were strong in May and early June, with less downward pressures on selling prices than earlier in the year. The 6/29-30/99                                    47 housing market remains generally strong, though new construction has cooled from its vigorous first-quarter pace. Manhattan's office market has been stable in the second quarter, with vacancy rates little changed and rents rising at a more subdued pace than in 1998. Purchasing managers indicate that manufacturing activity was mixed in May, while there were reports of an upturn in commodity prices. Local banks report a dip in loan demand, some tightening in lending standards, and ongoing declines in delinquency rates. The national economy, based on the most recent data, is continuing to grow rapidly and without increased inflation, because productivity growth is not only maintaining the approximately 3 percent level we have seen since late 1998 but if anything is improving. Our read on the second quarter is that productivity may have grown at an annual rate of 4 percent or even more. As one of the later converts to the view that the economy is behaving remarkably differently from the past, I think it is important to remind ourselves what we should believe in and what we do not have to make any leap of faith to believe. To deny that the economy has been showing much better productivity since 1995 is simply to deny the facts. How long will this improved productivity last? At what level of improved productivity will the economy settle? We do not know the answers to those questions. Should this lack of certainty about the future confuse us in the present? I do not think it should. We don't have to know how long the productivity improvement will last nor at what rate productivity will settle. Those answers will be known only in the future. We don't even know when. More importantly, we do not need to know. Most of us believe that the lag in the effect of monetary policy is one to two years. That is as far into the future as we need to peer. To try to look farther merely confuses us and perhaps makes us unwilling to believe the reality that is staring us in the face. I can see nothing that would alter my belief that productivity will rise at least 2 percent during the next one to two years. That means that the economy can enjoy noninflationary growth well within the forecasts of the Greenbook or of the New York Reserve Bank. We all say that labor markets are tight, but they have been tight for several years and workers have been found--many of them in pockets of poverty where finding a good job, or any job, was a forlorn hope. Should we be fighting that highly positive 6/29-30/99                                    48 development for the good of the American people? I think not. And yet the American public and markets everywhere are waiting for us to pounce on growth and job creation and stifle them. Since I do not believe we should do that, I believe that our challenge is to clarify our strategy--first to ourselves, then to the public and the markets. The markets are spending their time psychoanalyzing this Committee rather than analyzing the real world. That is highly counterproductive because it deprives our nation's economy of the balancing effects of the normal pulls of supply and demand in financial markets. Never-ending heavy breathing by market watchers is convincing the American people that we want to deprive them of inflation-free growth. Clearly, the general posture of the Federal Reserve should always be to remain highly alert to imbalances, to forces which could end sustainable growth. Our policy regarding price stability on a continuing philosophical basis should be seen as symmetric, as being against both deflation and inflation. Our strategy, on the other hand, should vary with conditions. Deflation is sufficiently unlikely at this time that we should have a strategic position of concern about inflation. But we should not be in a tactical position of being constantly poised to attack an enemy that does not appear visible to me. We need to find a way to tactical symmetry--to a position where we, the public, and the markets think we are watchfully waiting but not looking for windmills to knock down. Because of the public perception of where we are, I do not think we can achieve tactical symmetry by taking no action at this meeting. However, when we discuss what action to take in a later portion of the meeting, tomorrow morning, I am absolutely convinced that it must take us to tactical symmetry, even against a strategic background of concern about inflation. Thank you. President Poole. Mr. Chairman, it's obvious that everyone around the table is \\\"chafing at the bit\\\" to discuss policy, and I'm going to do my part to behave in a disciplined fashion here by just discussing the outlook. In the Eighth District the story is very simple; it's the same old story. We're seeing exactly the same kinds of things that we have been seeing for a good number of months now. I make a special point of trying to talk to my contacts about what seems to 6/29-30/99                                   49 be different, what seems to be on the radar screen that hasn't been there. My impression is very clearly that firms are successfully managing their labor market pressures. For example,                   is very concerned about the labor market situation for his company. He says that                      its needed employees at the Louisville hub. He says that the company is having a hard time all around the country--except in Philadelphia, Ed, by the way. He says he's having no problem in Philadelphia; I don't know why the situation there is different.                      higher hiring referral bonuses and retention bonuses. So, clearly, that company is concerned. On the other hand,                      who was quite concerned about his labor situation earlier in the spring, says that now his folks are able to find labor pretty readily though they are behind on IT staffing. What seems to be happening is that case-by-case firms are coming up against the labor market pressures and they are able to manage the situation successfully. Of course, managing the situation in some cases means that they are paying more wages or retention bonuses or something, so there's perhaps some up-creep in wages involved, although obviously it is not showing up in the national statistics. Another thing that has come on our radar screen is that our bank examiners are expressing a little concern--I want to emphasize it's a small degree of concern--about loan administration in the banks. Credit demands are strong enough and loan officers are in tight enough demand that our examiners have the sense that some of the banks they examine are simply not able to have disciplined loan administration. So there may be a bit of sloppiness in that area that could produce some problems later on. No one is very concerned about it, but I mention it because it was the first time I really had heard about that from our examiners. We have the same situation in agriculture and so forth that has existed for some time and has already been commented on by others, so I have nothing to add. President Jordan. Thank you. Several meetings with bankers in sixteen of the western and northwestern counties of Ohio two weeks ago revealed somewhat of a paradox in that area in terms of a very strong regional economy but simultaneously a very vulnerable economy. It's an area where manufacturing often runs double the national average as a share of total employment; most of that is motor vehicle-related production. 6/29-30/99                                   50 Auto companies and their various suppliers are by far the largest absolute employers throughout that part of our region. So employment levels and personal income growth are very high and spending growth has been exceptionally strong. But bankers increasingly express their worries about personal bankruptcies; the stories about people who were current and then suddenly file for bankruptcy have returned. They say it is fairly common to have two adults in a household using the entire paychecks from all four of their jobs, including all the overtime they could get, to service their debts. So when there is a loss of one of the jobs or loss of overtime or illness or divorce, then that's it. They can no longer service the debts. One banker emphasized the condition of his customers this way: He said he is not worried about withdrawals around the time of the century date change because his customers don't have any money in their accounts to withdraw. We have heard that, too! They said that their business customers continue to experience difficulty hiring, especially for entry-level positions. The bankers said they are often paying 18-year old teller trainees $11 to $12 an hour. Then they can't hold the inexperienced people long enough to take advantage of their productivity after the period of training, but it has been impossible to recruit experienced people. We also did a roundup of what was going on in tourism in the region, so if you haven't been there recently, come on up! [Laughter] Given that the south shore of Lake Erie is a major tourist destination [laughter] and tourism companies are a big employer there, we talked to people at Cedar Point, Geauga Lake, Sea World, and King's Island Park to see what they were doing. Ticket prices are typically up 10 to 15 percent this year and these places are having a great deal of difficulty in recruiting employees. Cedar Point had openings for 3,700 summer workers and in June they are running still about 200 short of their goal. They went to Europe, again hoping to recruit 500 workers as they did last year, and were able to get only about 350. They increased the amount of subsidies for housing and for employee and employee family discounts. And they increased their season-end retention bonus by 50 percent; a worker receives $650 if he or she stays the full 14 weeks of the summer season. We hear similar stories from the other parks. Sea World and Geauga Lake contacts said that a significant number--about 1/5 of 6/29-30/99                                     51 the total--of their concession stands haven't been opened and probably will not open this summer. Bankers are reporting strong loan demand for all types of loans and in addition are expressing concerns about credit quality. Some of our examiners also are starting to say that they are seeing very early signs of things they are not comfortable with. The ag sector is in very good shape in the sense that the planting was all done on time, conditions for planting were excellent, and since then we've had just the right amount of moisture and sunshine. So, as one said: All the farmers need to do now is sit and wait for a drought or a flood someplace else! But even the low crop prices are not restraining the price of farmland. One banker said that he has customers who recently have been acquiring new land at $2,000 to $2,500 an acre that will not produce cash flow of $1,000 an acre at current crop prices. So buyers are either counting on commodity prices to go up or they plan to use the land for something else. I'm not sure what the logic of that is. Also, for the first time in a while for us, we heard reports of foreign investors--Swiss and Canadians in particular--buying farmlands or even raw wooded lands. That may reflect capital preservation efforts on the part of some of the foreign investors. Our Small Business Advisory Council described commercial real estate activity, particularly shopping centers, as booming. One referred to an \\\"explosion\\\" of orders in the spring for hot tubs and in-ground and above-ground swimming pools. The problem is that labor shortages make it difficult to get the work done. So he went to Miami to recruit 20 workers, some with families--he claims they have green cards--and besides moving them to Columbus, Ohio, he provided them with housing as well. We also heard reports of rising medical costs, all of that usual thing. In the building sector, we were told that framing contractors weren't even bidding on some proposed new projects. Additionally, for some projects they had planned to start this summer it now looks as if they may not even start digging or preparing the sites. We did hear some reports, especially in machine tools, of some new orders coming in from Asia and Latin America. So that may be an early hint of positive developments there. We were told that a number of fast food restaurants in both central and northwest Ohio are often now open for drive-through business only. They don't open the eat-in 6/29-30/99                                    52 facility because of a lack of staff. So I assume that, quality adjusted, one might call that a price increase. A director in the national retail trade business said that this year is going to be phenomenal and will go down as a banner year for retailer earnings. He said retailers are worried that they are going to go into year-end with stocks that are too low to meet what they think is going to be seasonally very strong demand for clothing and other nondurables. We heard a lot of reports of food processing costs--refrigeration, transportation, container costs and so forth--rising fairly strongly. A director who specializes in came into this year expecting 800 number and Internet sales for all of 1999 to range between $300,000 and $400,000 but already had booked $5 million in such sales in the first five months of this year. Whether that is a reflection of aggregate demand or a shift in demand, I don't know. She feels that discretionary income is high and rising very rapidly. Also, we heard reports that the structural steel industry is improving. Industry contacts said, in fact, that right now order books are full through the third quarter and that because of large construction projects, especially stadiums, they expect to finish the year with a full book. Turning to the national economy, I wouldn't know what assumption to make about the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year in any case. While it is no doubt true that Y2K will foster some buying to accumulate stocks of various nondurable goods in particular, I don't know how I would go about making assumptions regarding consumer behavior or business expenditures for durable goods or plant or equipment or even recruiting and hiring decisions. If Y2K gets to be a media event with the degree of hysteria or concern about the future on the order of what we saw in the fall of 1990 looking toward Desert Storm and the Gulf War, we could have a very substantial negative impulse in the fourth quarter. And we would have to wait to see if that then reverses in the first quarter. I wouldn't know how to quantify the magnitude of that. I can see it going both ways. Also, if people want to enter the year-end period with a high degree of liquidity, that does imply, other things the same, a slower rate of spending for 6/29-30/99                                    53 something. So Y2K may influence the balance sheets and cash flows of firms as well as of households in a way that I wouldn't know how to put into a forecast. I have commented over the last year, year-and-a-half about the very rapid growth of personal income. In the spring of 1998 we were looking at Greenbook projections of personal income decelerating into the 3 to 4 percent range and it has run 1 to 1 percentage points faster than that. And that's great, as long as it stems from income that people are really earning based on what it is they produce. I heard last week--and I haven't had a chance to follow-up to see if it can be documented--that right now we're experiencing an inflow on the order of 1 million workers a year from foreign countries, augmenting the labor force. Now, as for how many of those are illegal and how many are permanent, I don't have any information. But the total is a very large number--much larger than I would have thought--and it certainly would contribute to rapid personal income growth. We can see what the effect of the rapid growth of demand is on the domestic economy and, of course, we can see it in the rapid growth of imports at a rate that I certainly consider unsustainable. I take that as the strongest piece of evidence of excess aggregate demand in the domestic economy, and at some point that surely has to be reversed. So I do continue to be concerned about too much demand chasing what we're able to produce in the longer run in this economy. I have a couple of comments on inflation. We continue to do research on various measures of inflation: We track the median CPI; we've also been looking at the regular CPI but using PCE weights. While the level of the latter measure may not be statistically significant, it has moved up appreciably. In the first five months of this year it ran right at 3 percent, even with the drop we had in May. Now, for the first time in a couple of years, that measure is running ahead of both the regular CPI and the median CPI that we track. So, that measure is another way of looking at the concerns about inflation that we have. All I'm saying about it at this point is that it's moving in an upward direction compared to what it has done in the last two years. One more comment on inflation numbers: We began a project some time ago, and are building a track record now, with our own consumer price outlook surveys to compare with the Michigan survey's perceptions of current inflation and forecasts of 6/29-30/99                                    54 future inflation. Our surveys have some different questions and a lot more detail in terms of the breakdown on respondents. First, both perceptions of current inflation and expectations about future inflation have moved up sharply. It's the direction that's important, not the levels, as far as I'm concerned at this moment. Some of the information that is starting to become available on the breakdown of income levels, education levels, males versus females we're not sure how to interpret. Consistently, females' perceptions of current inflation and future inflation run 1 to 1 percentage points ahead of males' perceptions. We don't have an explanation for it. We even break the data down as to whether the respondent is a member of a household and whether he or she is working or not working outside the home. So, without getting into too much detail about levels right now, since the beginning of the year all of these measures have turned upward in each successive survey. Governor Kelley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When the Committee made the third of its three cuts last fall, which was the final one that brought the federal funds rate to the level we have today, it was a close, difficult call. After a good deal of soul-searching, that action was taken largely--and please excuse the use of this old war horse once again --as an inexpensive insurance policy, which could easily be reversed if the economy appeared to be too strong. Very soon thereafter what had at that time appeared on balance to be financially driven downside risks began to migrate. For a while, the risks appeared to be balanced, but more recently they seem to have moved ever more clearly to the upside. Two groups of factors seem to me to be driving this change. For one, the world economy generally appears to have survived last fall's financial crisis and to be beginning to turn upward. This is a healthy and welcomed development, of course, but it does cause problems for U.S. monetary policy because several things that have helped our policy mix may well be changing. Our exports could increase, adding to already very robust economic activity. World commodity prices could firm; indeed, oil already has done so. The dollar's foreign exchange value could begin to weaken, adding further to exports and raising import prices in the United States. All of this is potentially inflationary. 6/29-30/99                                   55 Then there's our remarkably strong economy, which should slow on its own but so far has refused to do so. Consumer confidence is still sky high. Real wages are rising. Wealth continues to grow. Despite the recent hesitancy, the Dow Jones industrial average is up over 14 percent so far this year, and that's not too shabby. Consumption continues to increase at a rapid pace, led by the big-ticket cyclicals like autos and homes. Inventories are low and are likely to be a short-term source of further strength. Clearly, labor markets continue to tighten as the economy strains to keep up the beat. So far, strong productivity growth has made it possible to do so without visible inflationary pressures. But it seems to me that it would be a dangerous assumption to be confident that this could go on indefinitely. Things have been and indeed remain wonderful. But there are limits out there somewhere beyond which could lie serious trouble. Policy must, of course, focus one or more years out, not on today. And within the context of that time frame, I think we're quite possibly in the danger zone now and should begin to respond. Governor Ferguson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the obvious question we've all been addressing or attempting to address in our own ways is: What has changed since the last meeting? In some sense I think not much has changed since then. The incoming data continue to point to vigorous growth, which may well be above trend and therefore is of some concern, I think, to everybody around the table. Consumers are clearly the major engine for this growth, as the recent personal income and consumption data amply indicate. And while PCE growth may slow at some point, it is not slowing yet. The other side of this, as we all know, is that labor markets continue to be tight. The unemployment rate has been at 4.2 or 4.3 percent for three or four quarters now. That is starting perhaps, and I say perhaps, to spill over into compensation. Mike Prell's chart number 5 indicates that average hourly earnings of production workers decelerated a bit over the last twelve months compared to the previous twelve months. But if one looks more closely at the last three months--that is, the early part of this year--average 6/29-30/99                                   56 hourly earnings seem to be picking up again to somewhere in the 4 percent range. This obviously puts into stark relief the importance of ongoing improvements in productivity. There is continuing evidence that businesses are investing heavily in productivity- enhancing technologies. The recent shipments and orders data for communications equipment remain on a steep uptrend, as do the orders and shipments of office and computer equipment. The major issue, obviously, is whether or not this capital deepening will translate into further increases in the rate of productivity growth. On this issue I think there's anecdotal evidence on both sides, but the jury is out. Against this backdrop of ongoing labor market tightness, there are a couple of conditions that may have changed. Here I'll say nothing new but I will reiterate what others have said. One change, obviously, is that the international environment is not as threatening as it has been for much of the last eighteen months. The staff forecast clearly shows some uptick. More importantly, in April our exports posted the first gain in six months. Two industries where weak foreign demand has depressed shipments- construction machinery and metal working machinery--both posted sizable increases in May. We've already talked a bit about commodity prices, so I will simply echo the view that it seems as though commodity prices have bottomed out; the evidence is broader than just the oil side of it. Another perspective that I consider important is to look at how interest-sensitive sectors of the economy are behaving. Purchases of durable goods posted some healthy gains in May. I think the housing market is showing us a little of both strength and weakness here. The information in front of us indicates that sales of new homes and similarly sales of existing homes fell in May. But if one looks at more timely measures, such as builders' ratings of new home sales or applications for home mortgages, those have risen from April through June. So in addition to the auto sales that Governor Kelley referred to, there's some evidence of strength in other interest-sensitive sectors. As Vice Chairman McDonough indicated, however, we're not here to slow growth. Nor are we here to destroy jobs or to destroy wealth. We should be looking for the earliest signs of inflation. We had a bit of a surprise in the CPI number for April, but I think we were wise not to put too much weight on that; as the subsequent numbers indicated, perhaps some of what we saw in April was a bit of a fluke. The early 6/29-30/99                                   57 indicators of inflation are very hazy but all point in the same direction. I've talked about commodity prices and average hourly earnings. In addition, Mike Prell brought to our attention the PPI for intermediate materials, which moved up in March, April, and May- three upticks after declines in that index in each of the 10 previous months. There are a number of anecdotal stories about faster increases in prices and wages, as we've heard around the table. When I put all this together, it does seem to me prudent to take out a little insurance--to use that phrase--but not to react more strongly than the incoming information warrants. We can debate whether or not we see a wolf or a wolf in sheep's or dog's clothing or even the family dog, whichever it may be. But speaking of clothing, even in a balmy June it's important that the emperor not be seen in public without clothes whatsoever! [Laughter] Try to top that, Governor Meyer! That will be difficult! I read the incoming data on demand and production as generally consistent with a slowdown to about trend growth in the second quarter but not at all definitive on whether we are in the process of a more sustained slowdown from the 4 percent rate of growth experienced over the last three years. On the inflation front, the last CPI report reduced concern that we are already seeing a move toward higher inflation. But the recent pattern in CPI reports is consistent, in my view, with the interpretation that core inflation has now stabilized and that, therefore, the best inflation news is behind us. Concern that we may, in addition, be poised for an uptrend in inflation going forward comes mainly from the labor market, where there are some hints that demand pressures are now beginning to be felt in wage changes. This is the tone of the Beigebook. We also have the upward revision to the average hourly earning series and the rebound in the 3- and 6-month rates of increase in average hourly earnings in the last several months relative to the 12-month increase, following a period of deceleration. On top of this are reports of higher health insurance costs that are expected to boost the employer benefits component of the ECI going forward. The change in the Greenbook forecast, while not dramatic, certainly is in the direction of supporting the case for a higher federal funds rate target. While I thought the 6/29-30/99                                    58 rhetoric of the Greenbook was modified somewhat more than the forecast, I appreciated both changes. The 0.4 percentage point increase in core CPI in 2000 relative to 1999, the 2.7 percent core CPI inflation rate in the fourth quarter of 2000, and the momentum toward still higher inflation thereafter are the central stories in the Greenbook. This is consistent with my own concerns. Now, at Humphrey-Hawkins meetings, the staff also offers an extended forecast. This puts us in a better position to consider the longer-run path of monetary policy that is consistent with our policy objectives, rather than focusing exclusively on the decision about the target for the funds rate between today and the next FOMC meeting. This also provides an opportunity to consider the inflation risks associated with initial conditions in terms of current utilization rates and the prevailing momentum in economic growth. Let me note some of the important features of this extended forecast. Despite the 50 basis point tightening over the Greenbook horizon and the cumulative 150 basis point tightening over the extended forecast horizon, inflation moves up measurably. And the rise in inflation may be steeper than it appears on the surface. The reference price index is the PCE, which has been running and is expected to continue to run about percentage point below the CPI. The rise in the PCE inflation rate from just below 1 percent this year to just above 2 percent by 2001 and to a peak later of about 2 percent translates into an increase in core CPI from 2 percent over the last 12 months to about 2 percent in 2001 and a peak of around 3 percent. Add another 0.6 to 0.7 to put this number on a methodologically consistent basis with a 3.1 percent increase in core CPI over 1995. I think this helps to underscore the point I made at the last meeting: That there is a danger that we could squander a most extraordinary set of disinflationary forces over the last several years and allow this episode to be a transition to higher rather than lower inflation. The Greenbook forecast and my own, of course, reflect key assumptions about trend growth and NAIRU. Our forecasts have admittedly been very poor over the last few years. There is no question that there is an unusual degree of uncertainty on all counts. But the reasonable possibility of a significant rise in inflation is a concern that I will weigh in my monetary policy position tomorrow morning. Governor Gramlich. 6/29-30/99                                    59 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We're being increasingly admonished to fight inflation and not real growth. I wish it were that simple. Everybody loves growth. It improves living standards and a consonant growth in overall liquidity keeps inflation low. But even though growth is desirable, a nation can have too much of a good thing. If there is little economic slack as measured, say, by unemployment and discouraged workers, and if there are lags in monetary policy, the main way the Fed can control inflation is to control growth--that is, to keep the prospective growth in aggregate demand close to that of aggregate supply. To make a judgment of whether it is close, we must rely on forecasts. Even with an upward shift in productivity growth, a reasonable forecast for growth in aggregate supply over the next few years is around 3 percent, perhaps a bit above. A forecast for demand growth is harder to come by, and the staff's has certainly not been perfect. But the staff has learned from its misses and has incorporated those lessons into its new forecasts, so I'm willing to assume that they are now probabilistically unbiased. The baseline forecast that many of you referred to does already include a higher federal funds rate. The version that I prefer of the staff forecasts assumes no change in the funds rate. This shows that the forecast growth in aggregate demand is coming in above that of aggregate supply. Even including the flat Y2K quarter, the average growth in real aggregate demand in the unchanged funds rate version of the forecast is 3.3 percent over the next year-and-a-half; taking out this flat quarter, it rises to 3.8 percent. The true estimate is probably somewhere in between the two. This is not a huge supply/demand imbalance, but I think there is some imbalance. Since the forecast begins at a time when resources are tight, forecast inflation gradually accelerates by about  point per year in 2000 as opposed to 1999, with more acceleration in later years. Roughly the same pattern is shown in the Blue Chip forecast. This acceleration has been a standard, though largely unrealized, feature of the forecast for some time now. I've always been worried about it, but I'm getting a little more so lately for five reasons. One is that the long-awaited natural slowdown in the U.S. economy seems not to have materialized. Second, the world economy is beginning to recover. Third, commodity prices have stopped dropping and may even be turning up. Fourth, there are now more tight labor market anecdotes than before in the Beigebook 6/29-30/99                                     60 and elsewhere. Fifth, there are early if intermittent signs of acceleration in prices and even a touch in wages. After a long spell, it may now be time to worry about the gradual acceleration of inflation and to think about tightening policy. The same suggestion is given by targeting rules. A forward-looking inflation targeting rule would tell us to tighten. A forward-looking nominal income targeting rule would tell us to tighten. If the real interest rate is in the neighborhood of 3.8 percent, which is taken from the possibly biased TIP market, the nominal funds rate is probably too low from a long-term standpoint. None of these indicators is perfect, but all are starting to point in the same direction. Let me step ahead and talk about the \\\"tap on the brakes\\\" issue. Should there be a slight tap on the brakes or a stronger tap? The argument for a slight tap is that there is still a great deal of forecasting uncertainty in all of this and there is still time to make future changes if new data confirm our suspicions. Until we see the whites of the eyes of inflation, premature Fed moves do not let the new high productivity American economy reach its full potential. The arguments for a stronger tap are that the present funds rate may be too low by more than a slight amount, that it is difficult to raise interest rates, and that there are lags both in monetary policy and in the inflation process. In being too cautious and not taking advantage of windows of opportunity, delayed Fed moves let inflation heat up again after years of painful sacrifice to bring it under control. I'm not going to say where I am on this except to say that these were years of painful sacrifice. [Laughter] We will now adjourn until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Before we do, let me just remind you that the forecasts that you've submitted to Mike Prell are subject to revision, as you know. He would appreciate having any changes in your forecasts by close of business on Wednesday, July 7. [Meeting recessed] 6/29-30/99                                       61 Wednesday, June 30--Morning Session Mr. Madigan, you have the floor. This briefing provides background for your review of the ranges for money and debt for 1999 and your decision regarding provisional ranges for 2000. I'll be referring to the charts and tables from the Bluebook that have been distributed separately to you this morning in a package labeled \\\"Staff Presentation on Money and Debt Ranges.\\\" 3/ Last February, the FOMC reaffirmed the growth ranges for 1999 that were chosen provisionally one year ago: 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for domestic nonfinancial sector debt, shown in Chart 1. The Humphrey-Hawkins report in February noted the FOMC's continued uncertainty regarding appropriate rates of money growth in the intermediate term and stated that the Committee intended the monetary ranges to be benchmarks for growth under conditions of price stability, sustainable economic growth, and historical velocity relationships. In addition, the report pointed out that the monetary aggregates could exceed their ranges during 1999. As shown in the top panel of the chart, M2 has indeed been running above its range so far this year, with growth through June at a 6 percent annual rate. M3 growth for the year to date has been about 6 percent at an annual rate, just at the top of its range. Debt, by contrast, has been comfortably within its range. The relatively rapid expansion of M2 this year importantly reflects the brisk pace of nominal income growth. In addition, it has mirrored a further decline in V2, shown by the solid line in the top panel of Chart 2. To a small degree, the decline in V2 over the first half of this year probably was a lagged response to the drop in opportunity cost--the dashed line in the upper panel--late in 1998 following the easings of monetary policy. In the middle panel, the lower solid line, labeled \\\"Fit from 1959:Q2 to 1989:Q4,\\\" shows the historical association between opportunity cost--the horizontal axis--and V2, the vertical axis. Points corresponding to the experience over the period since mid-1994 are shown in the box and are repeated in magnified form in the lower panel. That scatterplot suggests that the demand for M2 may retain an interest sensitivity somewhat similar to that apparent in earlier decades. Since its peak in mid-1997, however, V2 has dropped considerably while this measure of opportunity cost has changed little on net. We can't pin down the reasons for the downtrend, but it seems reasonable to suspect that wealth may be playing a role. Large stock market gains have boosted wealth but have left portfolios skewed toward equities. As investors, in response, have diversified some of their wealth into other assets, such as deposits and money fund shares, 3 / A copy of the material used by Mr. Madigan is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 3) 6/29-30/99                                    62 M2 has been growing more quickly than nominal income. Nonetheless, econometric studies have not identified a clear role for wealth in M2 demand, and considerable uncertainty continues to surround the determinants of M2. Chart 3 shows the velocity of M3 in the upper panel and the velocity of debt in the lower panel. In 1999 V3 has continued to drop at a pace a bit quicker than its trend from 1960 to 1985. The velocity of debt has remained roughly flat, as was the case before the mid-1980s. Table 1 summarizes the staff projections for 1999 and 2000. As shown in the third column, M2 is projected to expand 6 percent over 1999, outpacing the 5 percent gain in nominal income forecast by the staff in the Greenbook and the similar central tendency of income growth in your own forecasts. The projected decline in V2 reflects an assumption of continued, albeit diminishing, portfolio influences and a small boost to M2 demand from Y2K concerns. These effects are partly offset by the assumed tightening of monetary policy this year. Next year, M2 growth is expected to slow further to 5 percent, owing in part to the deceleration in nominal income, which is anticipated by your own forecasts as well as the Greenbook. A reversal of the Y2K effects and the continued fading of the portfolio effect on money demand, given the projected leveling-out of the stock market, also contribute to M2's expected deceleration. M3, the second line of the third column, is forecast to expand 6 percent this year. The sharp slowing from last year's pace of nearly 11 percent mainly reflects a steep drop-off in bank credit growth after the surge that resulted from last year's market turmoil. Next year, M3 growth is seen as edging off to 6 percent, with the effects of the deceleration in M2 being partly offset by a strengthening in bank funding needs as bank credit picks up some. Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand 5 percent in 1999 and 4 percent next year, about in line with nominal income. The contraction in federal debt steepens, owing to the widening budget surplus, while nonfederal debt expands briskly, again outpacing nominal income, although it does slow. Table 2, on the following page, shows the two sets of ranges for money and debt presented in the Bluebook for Committee consideration. Both sets were developed under the presumption that the Committee would wish to retain its current, long-run price-stability rationale for the monetary ranges and the current projection rationale for the debt range. Under Alternative I, the Committee would keep the existing ranges for 1999. The ranges for M2 and M3 under this alternative are centered on growth rates that would likely prevail under conditions of price stability and historically typical velocity behavior, with a trend in potential GDP more in line with performance earlier in this decade--before the apparent recent improvements in 6/29-30/99                                    63 productivity growth. For instance, the M2 range of 1 to 5 percent under Alternative I would be consistent with potential real GDP growth of 2 percent, the staff estimate of  percentage point bias in inflation measured using the GDP deflator, no true inflation, and flat V2. Under this alternative, the same monetary ranges presumably would carry over to next year since the underlying assumptions would be unchanged. By contrast, the monetary ranges for Alternative II are designed to be consistent with an expectation that the stronger productivity gains of the past year or so will persist, with implications for more rapid growth in potential GDP. The M2 range of 2 to 6 percent could be roughly consistent with potential GDP growth of 3 percent, as in the Greenbook, the staff estimate of  percentage point bias in inflation using the GDP deflator, near price stability, and flat V2. For domestic nonfinancial sector debt, the Committee has not applied the price-stability rationale but instead has selected a range that has been approximately centered on its expected growth. Consistent with this approach, both alternatives propose ranges for debt that are roughly centered on staff projections. With the staff forecasting debt growth for this year of 5 percent, the existing 3 to 7 percent range would still be approximately centered on the expected outcome. Given the staff's projection of a slowdown in debt growth next year to 4 percent, the Committee might want to consider reducing the debt range to 2 to 6 percent on a provisional basis for 2000 as proposed in both alternatives. As it happens, such a range would be the same as one based on price stability considerations under the assumption of more rapid growth in potential GDP that is the basis for the Alternative II monetary ranges. Thank you. It strikes me that we have an interesting dilemma, which is merely a variation of the ones we've had previously, and that is to try to maintain a set of monetary growth ranges that we perceive as consistent with price stability. That problem was easy to deal with when we were talking about stable trend productivity growth; when that didn't vary very much it was easily interpretable into potential GDP and into specific money ranges. The issue that has been raised here, obviously, is an important one. If our true evaluation were that we needed to find the particular set of ranges that is consistent with price stability, the argument would have to be that we should raise the ranges. The only problem I have with doing so is that for some reason--mostly luck, I guess--we have managed to take this whole issue off the table completely. If we change the targets and we try to explain why, what of necessity is going to come out in the 6/29-30/99                                   64 explanation is that we have changed our structural productivity growth measure from 1 to 2 percent, and that is something we have avoided doing. I would be inclined to stay where we are, but in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in which this is discussed allude to the fact--since there will be other elements of the Humphrey-Hawkins report covering the issues of productivity and potential--that clearly these are minimal targets. The language would somehow suggest that these are not quite right but they're not that important. Were we to change them, we would only be changing them by a relatively small amount, which would not look all that much different on the charts. If you visualize what we're looking at, it's really not going to matter that much. All we would be doing if we change them, as far as I can see, is to open us up to discussing what the staff's trend productivity number is and then we'd get involved in defending it or not defending it. I feel like the politician who spends most of his time trying to avoid having certain questions asked. This is one of those questions I would just as soon not have raised because I think there are differences of view among the people in this room and it would serve no useful purpose of which I'm aware to get into this discussion. So, my personal preference is to stay where we are because I don't see that much has changed since the February meeting. Obviously, I don't feel strongly about it because one can't feel strongly about this [laughter]--and we shouldn't. That's my general view and I'd be curious to get reactions from everybody else. I think your advice and recommendation are right on target. I think we ought to keep this off the table. We have enough difficulties explaining where we are and what we are trying to do with monetary policy; it would serve no purpose to confuse matters with this unimportant issue now. So, I support your recommendation. Vice Chair. Mr. Chairman, on this issue I feel strongly only about one thing and that is that the fellow who has to go up and explain this should have the option of deciding what he wishes to explain or not explain. Therefore, I support fully your recommendation. I thank you, sir. President Moskow. 6/29-30/99                                    65 Mr. Chairman, I agree completely. I don't think it serves any useful purpose to open this up to a wide range of discussion at this point. So, I agree with your recommendation. President Minehan. I totally agree with your recommendation. There is one thing I feel strongly about and that is not conveying the sense to the world that we have a settled notion of what long-term trend productivity is now. Governor Meyer. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support your views on this. Another consideration, given the importance of the monetary aggregates in our decisionmaking, is the less said about them the better. [Laughter] President Jordan. Thank you. I agree with your recommendation of not changing the ranges. As far as discussing it in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and perhaps as a way to initiate more public dialogue about these issues, I would ask that some weight be given to the idea that in industries where we know productivity gains have been extraordinary--in the computer and communications industries, for example--prices are falling, as they should. And the wealth gains to businesses and households are manifested in an increase in the purchasing power of money because those prices are falling. The idea of price stability more broadly means that we would then accept more rapid increases in prices in other areas where there are no productivity gains so that the average stays the same, and it's not clear to me that that's optimal. That is a very important point. In fact, that's the issue I raised last night with Eddie George: What is a true, stable price level? In other words, is a stable price level one that is conceivably going down at a measurable and known rate provided the rate of return on investment is stable? Obviously, price stability per se becomes a much more complex question when we get into this technology area. We're using price stability, as best I can judge, as a general proxy with that caveat in it- at least I hope we are. I hope so, too! Governor Gramlich. 6/29-30/99                                   66 I think the Vice Chair put it well. I support your recommendation. President Guynn. Mr. Chairman, I agree as well. In addition to the arguments people have made, another matter is the timing. We may be in a period--we'll see in a few minutes--where we want to underscore our commitment to a low inflation policy. And to raise the targets at that same time might send a message to some people that we have a greater tolerance for- We would have to explain it. I certainly agree. President Parry. I agree with your recommendation. President Stern. I, too, agree with the recommendation, although I do think this raises an interesting question, mostly for the longer term. As a matter of logical consistency, if we do become convinced at some point that trend productivity and therefore trend output have accelerated, I think we are going to have to make an adjustment. But I don't think this is the point. Governor Ferguson. Me too! That's ungrammatical! [Laughter] I as well. [Laughter] Well done! President Broaddus. I as well. President McTeer. Let sleeping wolves lie. [Laughter] Governor Kelley. I concur, Mr. Chairman. President Hoenig. Yes. President Poole. 6/29-30/99                                   67 Yes. Why don't we have a single vote then? Will you read the paragraph? This language is shown on page 21 of the Bluebook: \\\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter 1999. The range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 3 to 7 percent for the year. For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.\\\" Shall we vote?  Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman McDonough Yes President Boehne Yes Governor Ferguson Yes Governor Gramlich Yes Governor Kelley Yes President McTeer Yes Governor Meyer Yes President Moskow Yes President Stern Yes Thank you very much. Mr. Kohn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The long-run strategies section of the Bluebook highlighted two potential imbalances shaping the U.S. economic outlook. One, the domestic saving/investment imbalance and the related current account deficit, has been a continuing concern to policymakers. Although the contrasting cyclical circumstances between the United States and the rest of the world have exacerbated the current account deficit in recent years, the deficit and the saving/investment imbalance importantly also reflect the pickup in productivity growth here. That pickup has boosted wealth and permanent income, 6/29-30/99                                   68 encouraging our residents to cut sharply their saving out of current income; foreigners are willing to supply the added saving needed to fund domestic investment because that investment has such high rates of return. The process is not sustainable: In the United States, saving is so low that the wealth-to-income ratio will begin to decline once capital gains abate; abroad, portfolios are becoming increasingly weighted toward dollar assets. There is little monetary policy can do to speed the adjustment. Tightening policy, for example, would damp income but appreciate the dollar so as to have modest net effects on the current account. The issue for policymakers is what price changes will be put in motion as this imbalance begins to correct itself. Once productivity growth levels out, current income will begin to catch up to permanent income; and domestic saving out of that current income will increase, reducing the equilibrium real interest rate in the United States and the dollar's real exchange rate. The latter would help to sustain demand in the United States and to contain the current account deficit. The role of monetary policy, if all goes smoothly, would be to lower the short- term interest rate, following the equilibrium rate down. However, events do not always go smoothly. There may be scope for alternative policies, depending on the way the dollar falls and how foreign investors react and on cyclical circumstances in the United States and foreign countries. Portfolio shifts away from dollar assets, for example, would call for a firmer monetary policy, as would downward pressure on the dollar from unexpected strength in foreign economies and their interest rates. The second imbalance highlighted in this section of the Bluebook has more immediate monetary policy relevance--and that is the possible imbalance in the labor markets. Behind the staff forecast and baseline extension is a judgment that the unemployment rate is now about a percentage point below its sustainable level and that the real federal funds rate is more than a half percentage point below its equilibrium level. Structural productivity growth is projected to remain at its recently elevated level of 2 percent. However, because productivity growth does not accelerate further, the effects of the overstretched labor market will begin to be felt. The rise in the nominal federal funds rate assumed for the second half of 1999 only prevents the real funds rate from declining over the forecast horizon. As a consequence, the imbalance in labor markets persists, and inflation continues to accelerate in 2001. The two long-run strategies presented in the Bluebook both deal with the economic and policy disequilibrium by raising the nominal federal funds rate 1 percentage points. If the increase is rapid, before inflation has a chance to pick up much, the real funds rate rises quickly and by enough to put significant slack in the economy, which counteracts the inflation pressures now in train and ultimately produces price stability. If the increase in the nominal funds rate is spread over three years, as in the baseline strategy, the pickup in inflation over this period implies that the real funds rate rises more slowly and only by enough 6/29-30/99                                    69 to return the unemployment rate to the NAIRU, capping PCE inflation at the 2 percent level. Revisions to the assumed NAIRU and to potential GDP growth have been unusually large in recent years, responding in part to overprojections of inflation. This experience suggests that uncertainty about the specifications of the supply side of the economy in the staff forecast and its extension might be quite sizable. The studies you received by Orphanides and by Orphanides, Porter, Reifschneider and Tetlow highlighted the extent to which estimates of potential, and hence the gap between actual and potential output, have been revised over the years. They also addressed the influence on appropriate monetary policy of uncertainty about the measurement of potential. They concluded that, because reacting appreciably to mismeasured output gaps will tend to add to variations in both output and in inflation, faced with such uncertainty you should reduce your response to estimated output gaps, with the reduction increasing more than in proportion to the degree of uncertainty. As the authors note, the Committee in fact appears to have been doing this in the past two years. Except when you are extraordinarily uncertain, however, the estimated gap should receive some weight in your policy deliberations. One alternative in response to uncertainty is not giving the level of the gap any weight in your policy reactions and instead paying attention only to the growth rate of nominal GDP relative to a targeted growth rate, which reflects a change in the output gap and inflation. This is a risk-averse strategy--very similar to monetary targeting when velocity is well behaved--which may be less than optimal, but would avoid large mistakes if the output gap turns out to be substantially different than perceived when policy decisions are being made. This research suggests that in a situation where the Committee is rather uncertain about the true level of labor resource utilization, it might attach the highest priority to seeking growth in the economy that would maintain the prevailing level of labor utilization unless evidence begins to accumulate that this level of utilization is inappropriate. To put this in practice in the current situation, the Committee would want to set its policy stance to provide some assurance that labor markets will not become tauter, but not necessarily to seek some easing of labor market pressures. Under this cautious approach, however, if the Committee began to see signs that cost and price pressures were emerging, tending to confirm suspicions that the economy was producing beyond its potential, it would want to react promptly and decisively. The Committee would need to make the determination of how much tightening is needed to bring the growth of aggregate demand back down in line with the expansion of aggregate supply. In this regard, is taking back the 75 basis points cumulative easing of last fall necessarily a good benchmark for policy going forward? To be sure, the market disruptions and tightening credit conditions that the easier policy was designed to offset have largely abated, and the real funds rate remains lower than it was last summer despite only modest net changes in unemployment and inflation rates since then. Moreover, when the 6/29-30/99                                   70 Committee eased, it was motivated in part not by the most likely economic forecast, but rather by the perception that the risks to that forecast were seriously skewed toward the possibility of major disruptions in global financial markets and foreign economies. The evening out of the distribution of those risks, without any other change in the forecast, would argue for some firming of policy. Finally, a reluctance to reverse course now, when market conditions have improved and labor market imbalances threaten, might make the Committee more hesitant in responding to rapidly deteriorating economic or financial conditions in the future. So, changing circumstances since the Committee last eased do provide a rationale for tightening, other things equal. But much has changed since last summer, with complex implications for the inflation outlook. Notably, even more rapid productivity growth has held inflation down despite a robust economy, and in financial markets credit conditions and bond yields are higher, while on the other side equity prices have risen as well. Moreover, the real funds rate last summer was not necessarily at its optimal level. Just as in 1988, the degree of any eventual firming should not be keyed to the size of the previous easing, but presumably would depend on the economic situation and the Committee's objectives--and could be more or less than 75 basis points. In the staff forecast, a fairly modest firming of the federal funds rate--50 basis points over the second half of the year--is sufficient to slow growth to a bit below the rate of growth in potential output, at least for a while. If it turns out that growth in potential output is higher because productivity continues to accelerate, real GDP need not moderate so much to stabilize labor utilization. But that more vigorous productivity performance will also likely induce stronger demand growth than projected by the staff as profits and equity prices are boosted. In that circumstance, some further policy firming may still be necessary to keep labor markets from tightening. Data becoming available since the last meeting do not suggest an economy or inflation process gathering the sort of steam that would require a sizable backup in rates to contain. In fact, economic expansion is estimated to have slowed in the second quarter to around the pace of its potential. Though compensation trends may be a bit less favorable than expected, 12-month changes in average hourly earnings remain damped and CPI inflation is probably a little lower than many on the Committee had feared at the last meeting. Financial flows also do not suggest an accelerating pace of spending. Money growth seems to be on a slightly slower track in recent months, even after allowing for the give- back of the surge of late last year, and credit growth continues to average in the neighborhood of 6 percent. Moreover, the recent growth rates of aggregate demand and of money and credit do not reflect the backup in interest rates of the last two months, which is too recent to have had much effect yet. Still, the signs of slowing are tentative, and, if labor markets are in the process of tightening further, the longer the slowing is delayed, the more cost and 6/29-30/99                                    71 price pressures will build. Under these circumstances, the substantial easing of financial conditions that would follow a decision not to validate at least the first policy-firming step already built into markets could be counterproductive. Hence, even a cautious approach to preemptive policy might suggest a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate to assure better that aggregate demand will rise no faster than aggregate supply. In addition to its decision about the stance of policy immediately after the meeting, the Committee also needs to consider its posture going forward. Such deliberations have always played a role at your meetings, but their importance has been heightened by the Committee's policy of giving a public rationale for its action and by the option to announce changes in the tilt of the directive. Beyond the action you choose today, there are three mechanisms available to convey your message to financial markets: the wording of the accompanying announcement, the tilt to the directive, and the tone of Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey- Hawkins testimony in three weeks. How you mix and match from these possibilities will importantly shape how markets react to your direct action and to the data releases and other events in the weeks that follow. If the Committee were concerned that a cautious approach to policy firming posed unnecessary risks that inflation would end up higher than was consistent with the good performance of the economy, it might see, and want to indicate, the possibility of an appreciable increase in the federal funds rate. An example is the price stability alternative and the incorporated 150 basis points of tightening in relatively short order. Even if the Committee were not intent on conducting policy over coming quarters to achieve literal price stability, it might have doubts that a less aggressive policy, as in the baseline, would serve even to cap the rise in inflation at a reasonable rate. These concerns would be heightened if the Committee were skeptical that the growth of aggregate demand would slow as in the staff forecast because, for example, such a slowdown depends on a leveling out of equity prices. Furthermore, the Committee may have sufficient confidence that a 4 percent unemployment rate is unsustainably low that it wishes to take strong, prompt actions to ease pressures in the labor markets before inflation begins to pick up. In these circumstances, the Committee might want to consider a 50 basis point increase in the intended federal funds rate, or a 25 basis point rise today with the strong presumption of a like rise within a few months. Such sentiments would be accurately reflected in an asymmetrical directive and perhaps in heightened inflation concerns expressed in the associated announcement and testimony. Any backup in rates this combination would cause would contribute to achieving the Committee's objective, given its view of the need for forceful action to contain inflation. The choice of the tilt in the directive is less clear-cut if the Committee were to take a more measured approach to preemptive action in light of aggregate 6/29-30/99                                    72 supply uncertainties. The Committee might still suspect that another tightening will be needed this year just to align the growth of demand with that of supply, as in the staff forecast. A reasonably strong presumption in this direction, and a sense that such a tightening is a real possibility in the next few months might lead the Committee to adopt an asymmetrical directive. The asymmetry would not come as a surprise to market participants, who would examine the announcement especially carefully for indications of whether your asymmetry extended beyond the next firming. But if the Committee saw that next action as somewhat uncertain--quite dependent on incoming data and not a precursor to a more extended series of firmings absent more concrete evidence of stronger oncoming inflation--it might want to adopt an untilted directive. Such a directive might also have some appeal because, by reducing the sense that action was imminent, it might help to forestall a market dynamic that risked building in stronger expectations of near-term firming than the Committee found comfortable. It would not preclude the Committee's giving its views that it continued to need to be especially wary of the potential for increasing inflation. And the expression of such concerns in the announcement and reinforced in the Chairman's testimony would help to limit any market rally that tended to emerge from moving to a balanced directive. Questions for Don? Could I ask about the change in the saving rate and the equilibrium interest rate that you talked about in the earlier portion of your remarks? Your comments seemed to imply that you do not perceive the current saving rate as the ultimate equilibrium rate and that you believe saving is going to move back toward the equilibrium rate. I'm wondering if that's really true. As I look at the extended simulations--and I can't be sure of the data that I have--that's not the story I see. To me the story in the extended simulations is that we have a decline in the wealth-to-income ratio and that the decline in that ratio leads to the readjustment of the saving rate. So it's really a question of whether the equity market is in equilibrium today. If the equity market isn't in equilibrium today, as it moves back into equilibrium it brings about that change in the saving rate. Is that what's going on? I think it's all part of the same phenomenon. The wealth-to-income ratio declines for a couple of reasons. One is that equity prices don't rise so rapidly relative to current income. There is a projected flattening out in the next two years, as you know, and very modest increases thereafter in the equity wealth-to-income ratio. But it's more than that because it's not only the behavior of the stock market, it's the fact that 6/29-30/99                                     73 people are not saving enough out of current income. We, the residents of the United States, are not buying enough of this wealth that's being created to keep our wealth-to- income ratio from falling at the current saving rate. So I think what happens here is that in a sense the growth in productivity levels out and this helps to level out the stock market because we don't have the continued capital gains and rise in profitability. It also brings current income up to permanent income. All those things work together to raise current saving out of income. So, the flattening of the stock market, the leveling out of the growth rate of permanent income, the catch-up of the growth rate of current income, and the increase in the saving rate are all a part of the same phenomenon, which is basically the leveling out in the growth of productivity. I think one could look at it either way: That the wealth-to-income ratio is falling and that's why people save more, or that the wealth-to-income ratio is falling in part because people save so little and that induces them to increase their saving. What about the equilibrium interest rate? We had some discussions previously about the role of the increase in the productivity trend in raising the equilibrium real interest rate. It levels out but at a higher level. Right. How do we sort that out in terms of what happens to the equilibrium rate when all is said and done? Well, when all is said and done, it ought to be at a higher rate than it was four years ago. Okay. But it ought to be at a lower rate than it is currently given the low rate of saving out of income and a very rapid rate of investment. As productivity growth levels out, investment tends also to level out. So the equilibrium interest rate should be lower later than it is now and on a downtrend as saving picks up, but at a level that's higher than it might have been 5 or 10 years ago. Thank you. President Hoenig. Don, I am going to try to ask this question clearly. In the Bluebook and in your comments you touched on a couple of issues. One was whether we 6/29-30/99                                   74 need to move 50 basis points over the course of this year and then how we might go forward from there. My question is: If one were to assume for the moment that we will need to move 50 basis points, what is the best way to go about that? If we say 25 basis points now, assuming we move at all, that would create uncertainties regardless of the tilt of the directive we adopt. A symmetric directive would give a false sense to the market and to Main Street that we're satisfied with that 25 basis points, and things would begin artificially moving forward again. If we say 25 basis points, asymmetric, that would raise uncertainty as to how much and when the next move will be. If we say 50 basis points, symmetric--suggesting that is sufficient at least for now--would that create more disruption because it's larger than the market expects? Or would that settle the market in the sense of saying, \\\"This is what we're doing and it's enough\\\"? If you were confident that you needed to move 50 basis points and it wasn't really dependent on the incoming data over the next couple of months, I don't think there would be anything gained by doing 25 now and waiting to do 25 later. So, in the case where you were confident that you needed to do 50 and didn't want to see more data, then you ought to do 50 and announce symmetry. I think initially the market would be very surprised and there would be a reaction. Depending on the announcement, the market might tend to build in a lot more tightening later. You would have to be very clear in the announcement that this is it for a while, as the ECB tried to do. I think those announcements are tricky. You don't ever want to tie your hands for very long after you've made a move. You don't know what's coming next. The sort of in-between situation is the one where you're fairly confident you need to do 25 now and you're not that confident about the next 25. If you're reasonably confident about the next 25 and see its likelihood as pretty high--it would take some unusual data to dissuade you and you're planning on doing the additional 25 at the next meeting or the meeting after that--I think asymmetry would accurately represent your views. The market would get wound up and build that tightening in, at least after its experience during the last intermeeting period, especially if its expectations were confirmed at this meeting. And that would be okay because in this in-between situation you actually do intend to do that next 25. But if you were less certain--if you thought the next 25 might be necessary but you weren't sure when, and if it were highly dependent 6/29-30/99                                    75 on the information you'd be getting over the next couple of months--then you might be concerned that doing 25 plus putting in the asymmetry would end up creating expectations of a further move. You would come to the August or October meeting with these high expectations embedded in the market but you might not want to move and you'd have given the market a false signal. The other option I tried to put on the table is that of going to symmetry and trying to calm things down a little--not creating strong expectations of a move at the next meeting. But in addition you could indicate in the announcement and in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that your major concern was still on the side that inflation pressures might be building and you might need to move. You just weren't so sure about that and, therefore, you didn't put in the asymmetry. Thank you. President Parry. Don, I have a question about the long-term simulations. Both of them indicate that there is a lot to do in terms of policy in the next year or two to reach our objectives. Since obviously we don't have much detail here, I was interested in hearing your views on the impacts of the alternative simulations relative to where we are today on such things as the stock market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market, and other vulnerable economies in the world. It seems to me that with the kind of policy changes indicated in either of those alternatives, but particularly in the price stability one, those impacts could be very significant. My experience would be that a long-run simulation isn't going to pick up much of that. The other point, somewhat on the other side, is that if we moved according to the price stability alternative, it's conceivable that we could see the sacrifice ratio change as well because such a move would be a very dramatic indication of our resolve with regard to monetary policy. As you put these simulations together, did those kinds of considerations come up? Let me take the second one first. We have built in a market learning process in the price stability alternative. The public, not just the markets but businesses and households, learn about this over about two years. So in some sense the actual goal is phased in and then the markets' learning about it is phased in. We smooth that through, but it is there. So whatever the Committee is targeting, markets and households do perceive it. It just gets built in gradually. The gradual adjustment of the 6/29-30/99                                   76 funds rate differs from an even sharper increase in the funds rate in the near term that would be indicated by the Taylor rule. So there is total credibility here. It happens over a couple of years, but it's built into the forecast. Unlike the old MPS model, which was totally backward-looking, this has forward-looking expectations and the credibility effects get built in. I see. It obviously includes effects on exchange rates and the stock market and that sort of thing. But what it doesn't include is some nonlinearity, shall we say. It doesn't take into account some unusual reactions that might occur because foreign economies, say, or even domestic financial markets are unusually nervous or unsettled at this point and might be more subject than they have been historically to a very sharp, sudden move in Federal Reserve policy. Basically this builds in how all these markets have reacted on average over time. We did not deviate from that. We did not in our simulations take account of the fact that the current state of the world may not be equal to the average over history and that reactions might be very much stronger in certain situations. Okay, thank you. President Jordan. Thank you. Don, the discussion about wealth, permanent income, measures of income and savings and all that in a domestic context is certainly very important. We're seeing more focus not on the creation of wealth but on the sharing of the wealth in a domestic context. We saw in the Chairman's JEC testimony recently some questions related to that--for example, is everybody participating equally? These are important comments, politically driven important comments. When the context is broadened to the global economy, the issues become much more complex in that the United States has been creating a great deal of wealth in recent years. We have our own interests about sharing the wealth and the distribution of income. But in a global context, in most of the places where we look at wealth and measure it we would say that they have been destroying wealth. The effect of the destruction has been most severe on those with lower incomes--Latin America, Asia, and so on--worsening their income distribution. 6/29-30/99                                     77 Now, suppose the rest of the world, not only the old industrial world of Europe but Asia and Latin America, starts to get its act together a bit, or maybe a lot--whether that involves the enforcement of property rights, tax reform, tax reduction, or deregulation--and they start getting the keys right to create wealth. Suppose they also address some of their other problems about the distribution and sharing of that wealth. Under circumstances where the rest of the world finally starts to perform well, what implications do you see for the United States? This is similar, in my mind, to what Karen was showing in the Chart Show yesterday--that is, the possibility of a portfolio shift in which dollar assets become less attractive relative to foreign assets, not because dollar assets are less attractive but because foreign assets are more attractive. From your perspective on the Committee, this might tend to accentuate any decline in the dollar. It would look like a portfolio shift against the dollar. In fact, it would be a shift in favor of foreign assets, but it would be a relative portfolio shift. It would put downward pressure on the dollar. And perhaps even in this very benign scenario of rising saving and downward pressure on equilibrium interest rates in the United States it would mean that you would need to have a less marked easing of policy as things corrected, or even a tightening of policy. Obviously from a global perspective this would be a positive development for the world. But it would mean that the United States would stand out less from the rest of the world than it has over the last few years. And I think portfolio preferences would shift as a consequence, and that would have an implication on our forecast--perhaps, as I say, accelerating the downward movement of the dollar. President Moskow. Don, I think we all feel that probably the most important thing this Committee has going for it is our credibility, the credibility of the Chairman. I was wondering about the effects on our credibility if we took the last option that you presented--if we went up 25 basis points and returned to symmetry--but soon felt that we had to raise rates further. If the inflation numbers in the coming months start to deteriorate and we feel that we have to increase rates, we would be doing so from a symmetrical directive not an asymmetrical one. Are you concerned at all that a 6/29-30/99                                    78 symmetrical directive would affect our credibility in the marketplace when right now they're assuming that we will have more than one increase this year? President Moskow, I don't think I am concerned if your concerns and your outlook are accurately expressed in the announcement and the Chairman's testimony. That is, you could move to symmetry but still express the view that the major development you're most concerned about that would threaten the good performance of the U.S. economy would be a pickup in inflation. You would indicate that you will be especially alert for that, but you don't have enough confidence that such a pickup is coming along to be able to say there's a high probability of moving at the next meeting or the meeting thereafter, which retaining asymmetry might imply. So I don't see a credibility problem with going to symmetry, provided the accompanying explanations express your concerns. There's nothing about symmetry that means you can't move if the information that comes in suggests that you need to move. The Committee has frequently taken policy actions from symmetrical directives. If the markets are surprised, so be it. The most important thing you do, obviously, is to make monetary policy. That you can prepare the markets and be accurate forecasters and tell them where the risks are coming from is a nice bonus. If you're right, that will help markets react in a stabilizing way consistent with your concerns. It's quite possible that you will expect one thing and something else will happen, but you could still react. I don't see symmetry and then action from symmetry as doing anything to the Federal Reserve's credibility, assuming the Committee gave an honest and full explanation of its assessment of the risks. And perhaps the nuances involved in that assessment could be conveyed better in that way than through the symmetry/asymmetry on/off switch. You obviously don't feel that the very strong reaction to the tilt announcement at the last meeting changes the historical view of how people look at our making a move from symmetry. My concern actually would be the other way. After you announced your tilted directive, a lot of observers noted that it had had very little meaning in the past--that only a small proportion of such directives had actually led to a tightening. But somehow that tilt put the spotlight on the Federal Reserve. And the interaction of that asymmetry and the statements coming from the Federal Reserve built in a much stronger 6/29-30/99                                    79 presumption of tightening than I think most of the Committee members had in mind when you made that move in May. So in some sense your concern might be that announcing an asymmetrical directive would provoke a market reaction that would not be consistent with how you plan to approach your next couple of meetings. I think an announcement of asymmetry has a problem also in terms of potentially misleading the markets about how you view your policy stance. May I ask a follow-up question on that? Go ahead. Maybe this question is for Peter Fisher since it has to do with the markets; I don't know. Wouldn't a switch to symmetry suggest that the risks are in fact balanced? My view is that you can give a sense that the risks are not balanced, but they're just not so unbalanced that you see a high probability of action at the next meeting. Yes, we're slicing the baloney very thin here! [Laughter] I think the Committee is in a very difficult position. The attention on its statements has become very intense; each word is examined. It's very, very hard to convey accurately the subtleties of a position where future actions are highly data-dependent. Yes, you think the next action is more likely to be a tightening than an easing, but you're not sure when. That's the information the markets are looking for and that's the sort of thing that used to be conveyed in the minutes and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. That is now conveyed in the announcements and the publication of the symmetries, but you have less opportunity to explain the nuances--to say on the one hand or on the other hand. So the Committee is in a difficult position. It is a position, I guess, in which you might argue that neither symmetry nor asymmetry, as the markets potentially see it, accurately represents your perspective. Given the potential reactions to the announcements, the question is how to walk through that minefield, how to least mislead market participants. Vice Chair. Don, even though in the 1994-1995 period we didn't announce a tilt until after the following meeting, do I remember correctly that we did seven consecutive firming moves and that each and every one of them was from a symmetric directive? 6/29-30/99                                   80 I know that we went to symmetry after each move. I'm not sure of the subsequent moves because they weren't at every meeting. Sometimes we skipped a meeting. I don't know. Norm Bernard, do you know whether the subsequent moves were from a symmetric directive? I know that every tightening was accompanied by a shift to symmetry but I'm not sure whether there was a shift to asymmetry in the interim. And the world didn't think that we had stopped being a responsible central bank just because we went to a symmetric directive? That's a question! I guess not! [Laughter] President Parry. Don, do you believe that the markets in the future will view a change in symmetry as a change in policy? I'd say they would view a change from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical directive as being a strong forecast of the next move. I guess one concern would be that they might come to interpret it as a stronger forecast than the Committee intended. Now, this may come out of the Committee's attempt to retain as a policy choice the option of asymmetry that wouldn't necessarily be published. In the process of explaining the Committee's policy on announcing tilts in the directive, we said the Committee would only publish strong asymmetries. The markets perhaps reacted to that, which may have made it worse. Peter Fisher's chart yesterday I thought was revealing. Bond rates actually went down in the week after the asymmetry was published. So the publication of the asymmetry per se didn't build in this tightening. I don't have a fed funds futures table in front of me, but my memory is that those futures moved a couple of basis points--3, 4, or 5 basis points on the publication--but didn't do much thereafter, or may even have come off a little. I think the publication of the asymmetry interacted with subsequent events to build this tightening in; it put more attention on the statements of the Chairman and other Committee members and then that built in the tightening. Now, what we don't know is what the markets will read from this last intermeeting period if, in fact, the Committee tightens today. We don't know whether they'll say: \\\"See, we were right; you published asymmetry and then you tightened.\\\" If 6/29-30/99                                   81 there were a couple of instances where you went to asymmetric directives, published those asymmetric directives and didn't tighten, I think the market over time would learn that asymmetry isn't necessarily a serious indication of an imminent policy move. But you would have to be willing to live with markets building in something, then taking it out, which isn't awful if you want to retain the asymmetry as a softer indication of the balance of risks. But I think it would involve a learning process for the markets. Any further questions for Don? I have just one quick question and perhaps I should direct it to Peter Fisher. Peter, is there any active discussion--and if so, to what degree--that market participants are looking at the symmetry/asymmetry decision as opposed to the move itself at this meeting? How much explicit discussion is there of that? I think a great deal of the markets' attention over the last couple of weeks has not been on how many basis points the Fed will move at this meeting but on what the wording of the announcement will be and whether there will be symmetry. Our traders have responded to foreign central banks wanting to know the rules this Committee follows in deciding whether to say something about symmetry or not. The whole world is really interested in the second part of the announcement That's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure. They are interested in the process. I think the more general point, President Broaddus, is that what the world is really interested in is the Committee's views of where it is going from here. They have the 25 basis points built in. Now they want whatever clues they can get about where you are going; the symmetry/asymmetry is a clue but it may not be the only one. I'm trying to figure out how to do that. Any further questions for Don? If not, let me get started by saying that I think we have to move at this meeting, but before I comment on that I would like to bring a much broader issue into the discussion. The reason is that, at least from my point of view, that issue comes to grips with a number of the crucial questions that we have to answer in order to get an effective policy. We would like to go where the economy and the financial system suggest we ought to go, whereas everybody else is looking merely at where they think we are going irrespective of why. 6/29-30/99                                    82 At the last meeting, I thought I saw signs that the surge of cost-cutting and hence productivity acceleration were beginning to crest. I was mistaken. After a short hiatus of continuous upward revisions of company five-year earnings expectations, the upward revisions resumed late last year and, if anything, have accelerated. The forecasts this month of five-year cyclically adjusted growth of expected earnings per share for the S&P 500 are a full  percentage point higher than late last fall. I can't say that I believe the rate of long-term annual earnings has truly shifted up  percentage point in so short a time frame, only that companies are telling security analysts that that is the case. Some of this revision surely reflects a pickup in projections of foreign affiliate earnings in Europe, Japan, and developing Asia where those data have been showing some strength in the most recent quarters, but most of the pickup of necessity reflects domestic earnings. There is little evidence that the explanation is a change in long-term price forecasts. Indeed, the forecasts have been holding for quite a long period of time to the notion that there is no \\\"pricing power.\\\" Nor is it an upward revision in long-term population growth; that I am almost certain is true. Further, it probably does not reflect a major increase in the share of profits relative to wages. What we are observing in the earnings forecast series, as best I can judge from a disaggregation of these numbers that was carried out in considerable detail, is the statistical reflection of the anecdotal evidence of dramatic breakthroughs in information technology and most recently the surge of Internet applications. The presentation last week to the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago was one of many that I have heard in the last several months on this issue. What I found particularly interesting in the discussion that Mike Moskow organized was the concern going forward of regarding indications that Internet commerce suddenly appeared to be accelerating. Very substantial actions were going to be required on the part of counter the competition coming from this very different, low-cost distribution system. is in the process of making a major shift from its conventional \\\"brick and mortar\\\" stores toward the Internet and related technologies, with very profound effects on its employment. And while we are acutely aware of the very dramatic changes in productivity that have occurred in the manufacturing area as a 6/29-30/99                                    83 consequence of just-in-time inventory management and capital flexibility, it is less clear how much of that has been happening in the distribution sector. But it now seems, on the basis of a number of very recent reports, that we are seeing an acceleration of activity in this area that suggests the early development of some form of critical mass that will enhance productivity in the distribution sector over time. I am not sure whether the 4 percent annual rate of increase in productivity estimated by the New York Bank for the second quarter is right, but we do have fairly good evidence that manufacturing productivity in the second quarter has accelerated quite significantly from the most recent trends. Indeed, if we take what we reasonably know about manufacturing productivity, the number in the Greenbook for the second quarter for nonfarm productivity growth implies that either nonfinancial, nonmanufacturing corporate productivity growth is down sharply or, as I suspect, noncorporate productivity is negative--or some combination of both. In short, the possibility that our Greenbook's second-quarter nonfarm productivity estimate is on the low side, given the harder numbers for manufacturing, is not to be dismissed. So while your 4 percent number, President McDonough, was probably grabbed out of the air, more or less, it may well turn out to be correct. Algebraically, the percentage increase in long-term expected earnings in the context of a stable long-term profit-to-wage relationship is equal to the sum of the expected inflation, the expected percentage rise in aggregate hours or population, depending on the way one may want to look at it, plus the expected percentage increase in productivity. It is not likely that the upward revisions in forecast earnings since late last year reflect revisions in expected inflation or population growth. And assuming the earnings of foreign affiliates are not distorting this picture too much, the implicit revisions in earnings forecasts that are being reported by business firms seemingly reflect the equivalent of a  percentage point rise over the past several months in the expected trend productivity growth rate. Now, I'm not saying that they are right. I'm merely indicating what the broad sum of anecdotal information filtering into a large number of security analysts who are evaluating S&P 500 companies is in effect saying. This raises, in my judgment, some really important questions. 6/29-30/99                                    84 Our Greenbook forecasters have chosen to use the same trend growth rate for all quarters of their forecasts. They have always done that. It's automatic. They don't make a distinction from one quarter to the next even though I would suspect that when we look back on this period, we are going to get a nonlinear, or more exactly an accelerating, longer-term growth path as the only way to fit the data. With the econometric structure we employ, an unchanging productivity trend algebraically requires inflation to accelerate if we have an estimated NAIRU that is above the unemployment rate, which we do. If trend productivity is accelerating, however, the forecast inflation rate can stabilize or even fall. So the implicit forecast of rising inflation that we have had in all of our discussions this morning logically requires that the productivity growth rate be stable or at least accelerate only very modestly. Does the funds rate need to be increased by 50 or 75 basis points as is indicated in the Greenbook forecast? The answer is \\\"yes\\\" if our models capture reality. Obviously, once output per hour stabilizes even at a high rate, the acceleration of inflation resumes provided, of course, that the NAIRU remains above the unemployment rate. We have no evidence at this stage of which I am aware, however, that indicates the acceleration in productivity has ended. All of our experience and courses in Econometrics 101 induce a visceral antipathy to such persistence in productivity gains, especially for me since I have the oldest gut in this room. [Laughter] What is increasingly evident is that something seems to be happening that none of us has ever witnessed before--perhaps a once-in-a-century structural shift in how goods and services are produced. People in the front lines of business operations, such as Jack Welch of GE and Lou Gerstner of IBM, say this is a true revolution. They have seen nothing like this in their experience. And I venture to say that if we get on the phone with a number of business people who have been around a long time, we are going to hear this view from all of them. No one is saying that this accumulative, technology-driven productivity growth is showing any signs of slowing. I would not go that far, but I believe something profound is happening. We are observing market capitalizations that are telling us something very interesting even as we simultaneously argue that stock market prices are overvalued. We are seeing a very dramatic shift in the changing capitalizations of high-tech versus low-tech companies. 6/29-30/99                                     85 But even the low-tech companies are not showing any significant real destruction of market values, though that's only because there are no low-tech companies anymore. The least efficient types of steel operations, such as those employing blast and oxygen furnaces and old-fashioned rolling mills, if that's all they were, would long since have disappeared from the industrial scene. But they have stripped workers out of rolling mills at a rate that is unbelievable, and we are left with high-tech steel operations--to the extent that we can have them with that obsolete structure of making steel. I had a conversation with                              on the question of what will happen to the market values of real estate in malls if indeed we experience a significant shift to cyber space types of distribution. In that event, the commercial buildings will no longer have the importance that they now have. The one saving grace in all of this, as I believe I said           is that shopping is not a fully economic activity. In fact, most people actually seem to shop for entertainment and other reasons. So, shopping malls are places involving what might in a sense be viewed as cultural activities. Shopping is what people do. We are not dealing with a wholly economic issue. I am not saying that it is appropriate for                        with their huge real estate investments, to be significantly worried. But there is something going on in the economy, something profoundly important, and we don't know where it is going to lead. The mere fact that some profound economic change occurs every century must put us on guard to make sure that it doesn't happen on our watch without our being aware of it. If it's real, it is crucially important and very significantly complicates our task in setting monetary policy. How do we know when an economy is overheating? We cannot tell from the rate of economic growth by itself. Obviously, if output per hour is accelerating, so are real income and GDP. And if output is accelerating, that of necessity has to show up in the spending components since the accounts must balance. Currently, motor vehicle sales are running well in excess of past trends. Housing sales are absurdly high. Capital investment is strong. So, are we really saying that the economy is overheating because we are looking at a 17-plus million annual rate of automobile sales and new home sales 6/29-30/99                                    86 that are moving up to a 1 million annual rate? That, in and of itself, says nothing about the degree to which this economic system is overheating. We cannot tell until we look at the combination of aggregate supply and aggregate demand. The reduced form view of all of this is whether or not we have slack in the product and/or the labor markets. If we have a situation in which effective demand exceeds potential supply, then prices rise. If it is the other way around, they fall. What we have now is clearly an ambivalent set of circumstances in that we are getting a very dramatic acceleration in aggregate demand but we are not seeing the usual effect in prices. Or more exactly, from the point of view that I think is relevant, we are not seeing it in unit costs. Indeed, the data that we put together, or more exactly that Larry Slifman puts together by extending the information that we get from the BLS and Commerce on unit costs in nonfinancial corporations, suggest that for the quarter just ending--and this is consistent with the Greenbook which, remember, I suspect has a low productivity estimate--the change in unit costs is effectively zero over the past four quarters. Prices are up somewhat because margins seem to be rising in certain areas. Overall, margins have risen a good deal from the fourth quarter of 1998. The reason is not that prices have been accelerating. It is that unit cost growth rates have been falling. In that regard, when we look at a system where short-term earnings expectations are accelerating quite pronouncedly--certainly that is the case for the first quarter and also for the second--that is telling us that profit margins are opening up in the context of a decline in unit cost growth. This is scarcely an indication that effective demand is exceeding potential supply at this particular stage. We certainly don't see it in terms of product market tightness. We don't see any particular shortages. Where we do have a problem is in the labor markets. If we had a fully balanced system in which output and demand were equal to working age population growth plus trend productivity growth, then one would presume that we had a stable system. We don't have that at the moment. We are continuously reducing the number of people who would like to work but don't have a job. That number is going down, though it is going down less than it was a year ago when the pool of available workers was shrinking at an annual rate of a million people. That number is now down to about 500,000, which is roughly equivalent to  percentage point in potential GDP growth. In other words, aggregate demand is currently running in excess of potential growth by about that 6/29-30/99                                    87 amount. And that, as best I can judge, is being engendered wholly by a wealth effect. In fact, our estimate of the wealth effect is greater than that. The point I am trying to make here is that we have a situation that is out of equilibrium. We don't see it in the price data currently. What we do see is a situation that, if it continues indefinitely, must create some problems in the labor market and eventually in unit labor costs and prices. At that point we clearly will be experiencing a real-time inflation process. The one thing I find a little puzzling at this stage is why the rates of decline in both the unemployed and the broader category of job seekers are slowing. One argument obviously could be that we are running out of people and are scraping the bottom of the barrel. But if that were the case, we would see far more in the way of anecdotal reports, not to mention statistical data, on increasing average hourly earnings. It may be that when the data for June come out on Friday we will see a big pop, and we will then be able to say \\\"problem solved.\\\" But that is by no means evident. To be sure, the last Beigebook did show a little more evidence of labor market pressures. But we do not have clear-cut, unequivocal evidence at this stage that the economy is in the process of accelerating. If we believe the economy we have today is truly captured by the forecasting structure in the Greenbook and in the extended projection of the Bluebook, then the policy issue that Tom Hoenig raised would be up front on the table and in my judgment definitive. My answer to Tom is that if we believe the staff forecast, the argument for 50 basis points and going symmetric would I think be overwhelming at this point. My problem is that as I see it the structure that is actually governing this economy is not being properly captured in the models used for the forecasts. I believe the evidence that we have to date suggests that the 2 percent trend productivity number is already obsolete. I suspect we are going to find that to be the case as the year goes on unless the individuals in the business community with whom we interact are completely missing the boat. We would not be seeing the profit figures and the economic growth that we are observing if what all these people are saying is wrong. And we surely would not be seeing declining rates of inflation in unit costs. Indeed, after this extended period of economic expansion we would not be seeing a four-quarter average change of zero, or 6/29-30/99                                     88 actually -0.1, in the unit costs of nonfinancial corporations and of 0.2 in unit labor costs. This is not the type of economy that is well captured by the econometric structure we have built into our Greenbook forecasts. One only needs to go back and look at the Greenbook forecasts to see that the projected trend productivity number is higher in each successive Greenbook. I don't know whether the surge of cost-cutting and the acceleration of productivity have reached a peak. As I said at the beginning, I thought at the time of the last meeting that there was some evidence that that was indeed the case. The stabilization that I felt was happening has disappeared and productivity has surged dramatically higher. I do feel uncomfortable with the funds rate at 4 percent, and I think the appropriate thing is to move it up to 5 percent if for no other reason than to undo part of the 75 basis point reduction that we put in place during the fall. That clearly was a reaction to events which, as Don Kohn just said, have changed. There is the longer-term issue of our labor markets still being out of equilibrium even if we can explain why wage pressures are not as strong as I, at least, think they really are. I know our wage-price equations do capture this in part, but I am frankly a bit skeptical and fearful that a little data mining is involved in this process. If we are looking at the issue of symmetry versus asymmetry, I don't think the realistic question relates to the most likely direction of the next move we are going to make. Unless the economy comes apart unexpectedly, I think the chances of our having to move the funds rate lower are close to zero. The next move we are likely to make is almost surely up. If that is indeed our expectation, we would have concluded under our past regime that that calls for asymmetry. But we are now in a new regime and those terms no longer mean what they did in the past. I was startled by the extraordinary market talk after we announced an asymmetrical directive following the May meeting, though the correction in the federal funds rate that actually occurred was modest. We might as well have raised rates at that point as far as I am concerned. What I find quite bothersome is the existence of at least some evidence, although Don Kohn tells me it's somewhat dubious, that a lot of corporate treasurers are allegedly borrowing ahead for the purpose of beating the Fed to the punch. Indeed, what we are looking at is a long-term 6/29-30/99                                   89 interest rate that is moving up because market participants think the Fed is going to move. In the process we are losing our ability to understand what the markets are telling us. I am concerned that we are looking in the mirror. What we are endeavoring to do is to evaluate objectively what is going on in the economy and to craft monetary policy to appropriately address what we observe. But with our new announcement procedure, I am fearful that we may inadvertently have created a situation in which financial players are reacting to what we are doing and in the process causing the markets to run ahead and give us signals that are inappropriate. I believe it was Ned Gramlich who pointed out that the federal funds rate is lower at the moment than the real implicit long-term rate. I suspect there is a good policy argument there, but I'm not sure that the real long-term rate is the market rate. I think it may be the Fed viewers' rate of the day, and I am not sure that helps us because we can then get ourselves caught in a bind. I know that sounds a little peculiar, but I think the way Don Kohn put it is probably what we ought to be doing, namely to go to formal symmetry. We also would, as we have in the past, suggest that our real concern is the risk of rising inflation. We do have potential imbalances in that direction and very little evidence on the other hand that our next move is going to be to lower rates. So I would suggest, for discussion at least, that we raise the funds rate 25 basis points today, go back to formal symmetry, but include wording in our announcement that we have used in the past when we were going asymmetric. That's a longer speech than I had intended to make. Very interesting. Vice Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I agree fully with your recommendation and let me explain why. In my view there is no question that we should raise the fed funds rate. A failure to do so would create an extraordinarily strong reaction in markets; I think the first trade would be up and I'm not quite sure where the second trade would be because people would wonder where Federal Reserve policy was now headed. The issue really becomes the question of the announcement and the tilt. I agree with you fully--and as I mentioned yesterday--that financial markets are simply not 6/29-30/99                                   90 functioning in a way that a market economy needs to have them function. Markets have to have bulls and bears and buyers and sellers to function effectively. Instead, what we have is people trading off a new breed of Fed watchers who are more involved in politics and amateur psychoanalysis than the old Fed watchers who tended to look at all the numbers and variables. This phenomenon, I think, is extremely counterproductive and something that we need to move against by shifting our approach. I tried to make the distinction yesterday between the philosophical role of the central bank, which is clearly price stability on a symmetric basis, and the need in a shorter time frame to distinguish between strategy and tactics. I believe the intermeeting tilt should be described as tactical. Since it is not clear when we will have to make the next tightening move, it seems to me that tactical symmetry is appropriate and that is what I believe you recommended. The question is: How do we go about establishing what I would describe as strategic asymmetry, if the likely imbalances in the market develop in the direction of requiring further tightening? I think we have to do that through the new vehicle of the statement regarding the policy objectives of the Federal Reserve that will accompany our action this afternoon. I also agree that if we were absolutely certain that we had to increase the funds rate by 50 basis points, we ought to do it today and go symmetric. However, I think that would be very, very difficult to manage. We have had a poor record in this Committee in trying to give a signal that we have done something and that's it; and certainly the recent experience of the European Central Bank would not lead one to believe in such an approach. The last time I remember our doing that was in August of 1994 and it was a mistake then. I think a lot of us were rather queasy about what we said then. We should have been because it was the wrong thing to say given that we did continue to tighten after that, and rather soon after that. In addition to the fact that it would be very difficult to manage, there are two other reasons why it isn't altogether clear that we need to raise the funds rate another 25 basis points this year. I have a feeling, in one of the older stomach linings in this room, that the new once-in-a-century type of phenomenon is actually likely to be happening. But as central bankers, with monetary policy lags of one to two years, we don't need to 6/29-30/99                                    91 sign up for that view now. All we need to do is have a reasonable degree of confidence that it is likely to continue for the next one to two years. And I think there is every reason to believe that. Lastly, on the issue of labor force tightness: Without any question all of the anecdotes that we hear that markets are very tight here and there--in fact, in most places- are clearly right. But just as the economy is changing, I think the labor force and the availability of people in it are changing too. We have within our society fairly large numbers of people who really thought jobs were not available for them. We are changing that. The nature of the way the economy is behaving, the beneficial effects of what has been-- either by good luck or good guidance or some of each--very effective monetary policy is making it much more likely for many people to think that they can really have a job. The data on the labor force--data measuring those who might like to be in the labor force-- don't pick up such people very well. If we can continue to find that difficult-to- define pool and bring these fellow citizens into the labor force, I think that is a very good thing. We can't base monetary policy on the hope that that will happen; it may happen, it may not. But it's another reason to be observant of that change in the labor force and in the availability of people to join the labor force--changes that flow from the changes in the real economy. That's something else we have to be aware of. Thank you. Governor Kelley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me thank you for those extremely provocative remarks. I look forward to working on digesting them as soon as the transcript is available to us. But on a much more prosaic level, let me say initially that I strongly support your recommendation. I think there are two sets of reasons to be cautious about moving too aggressively right now. The first revolves around the uncertainties of today's economic situation, and in that regard I would make a couple of points. This economy could slow spontaneously. In fact, it is doing so in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. If we look at consumption and include housing as a consumption item, that represents over 70 percent of GDP. If we throw in capital expenditures, it's well over 80 percent. I can think of a number of reasons why a great many of those components could very easily grow more slowly. Even if they 6/29-30/99                                   92 remain at a high level, their rates of growth could be substantially lower. Just because they haven't done that so far doesn't necessarily mean that they can't or won't. Secondly, and this is partly what you referred to, Mr. Chairman, the trends of the recent past could very easily extend for a long time. Extremely strong productivity may very well have a long life ahead of it. Inflation may stay quiescent as it has been. If the economies of the rest of the world stay somewhat more sluggish than we are implicitly thinking, that may happen; and it would have a strong impact. Lastly, we have a stock market that is in a very precarious position. It's very fragile and I think very shock prone. Investors can take their chances, but the concern is that stock market developments could have a strong impact on the real economy. Another factor in play here--and this harkens back again to your remarks, Mr. Chairman, and to the dialogue with Don Kohn a few minutes ago--is the dynamic that we may have set in place with our new policy of releasing the Committee's views much more freely. I think our first venture out with an announcement of our tilt in May really went quite well. The markets seemed to understand it quite accurately and accept it for what it was. Why we did it was interpreted fairly well. Markets moved. And here we are, we're moving. It worked okay this time around; I think the reaction was quite responsible. But I think we ought to be careful about being too comfortable that this is always going to be the case. This new policy we have now is being watched with unbelievable intensity and apprehension, not just by market players but also by the man on the street for perhaps the first time. My sense is that it is broadly perceived by Wall Street and Main Street that under the old regime, as they came to understand it, these tilts meant very little to them but that under the new regime they probably mean a lot more. And they just don't know what that meaning might turn out to be. That is a perfect setup, I think, for a very serious misinterpretation or overreaction on the part of the public. To avoid that, this Committee should be very judicious and very cautious in how we bill this policy and its announcement. I fear that if we do more than just a 25 basis point tightening today, then we are going to run a wholly unnecessary risk of losing control of events here and of very possibly creating substantial and unpredictable mischief. Let's remember, of course, that we can tighten any time we feel it's necessary; and we can do 6/29-30/99                                     93 it, and have many times, from a symmetric directive. We can so indicate in the announcement that we release this afternoon. Thank you. Governor Meyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Greenbook forecast, which is not far from either the consensus forecast or my own, suggests that we will not be able to stabilize inflation at an acceptable rate without multiple tightening moves. Given the risk of higher inflation, the 50 basis point tightening this year that is incorporated into the Greenbook forecast would in my view be prudent and appropriate. That would mean doing the 25 basis points today and another 25 basis points later in the year, subject to the condition that data in the interim do not disconfirm the need for a second move. I believe there are few risks of moving in this direction, given the strength of the economy today, initial conditions in terms of labor market tightness, and our ability to reverse course if necessary. There is, on the other hand, considerable risk in doing nothing. This is another example of the maximin strategy: Consider the worst outcomes under various policy alternatives and select the policy with the least bad outcome. Mr. Chairman, you talked about the possibility that productivity is still accelerating, and that might be the case. If it is, I expect it also means that the equilibrium real interest rate is rising as well; and in that case it seems to me that there is little damage to be done by such a modest increase in interest rates. I want to spend some time talking about policy rules and the issue of how to operate with uncertainty about the measurement of the output gap. The papers that were prepared for this meeting were, I think, very provocative and interesting and deserve some comments. The policy prescription from the simple Taylor rule would yield a more aggressive near-term tightening than the one I suggested. But a similar trajectory over time is in the Greenbook in the extended forecast. The policy called for under the Taylor rule would fall into two phases. The first phase would be what I'd call the reassessment or the releveling phase. That is, the rule would call for immediately reversing at least the easings of last fall for a return to the prescribed path for the target funds rate. The second phase would be in response to changes in the unemployment rate and the inflation rate going forward. 6/29-30/99                                   94 Now, the Orphanides et al. work on uncertainty about the output gap suggests attenuating, though not eliminating, the response of the funds rate to changes in the output gap. It suggests, therefore, only a partial return to the level-based Taylor rule prescription, but would yield the same \\\"phase two\\\" increase in the funds rate in response to higher inflation. The conclusion in these papers that policymakers should downweight their response to changes in the output gap in the face of uncertainty about its measurement is both very intuitive and very sensible. But there is a difference, as emphasized in these papers, between downweighting the response to the output gap and ignoring the output gap altogether. This is the difference between uncertainty and total ignorance. I would note also that the Orphanides, et al. prescription is symmetric. For those inclined to applaud the downweighting of the output gap at the current policy decision point, keep in mind that the same logic implies that we should also respond by less to increases in the unemployment rate as the economy weakens. We can't have it both ways--to be aggressive to a weakening in the economy and passive to a strengthening unless, of course, we want to guarantee higher inflation over time. These papers highlight very effectively the importance of flexibility in using policy rules. Policy rules are best used to inform judgment, not to displace judgment. At times we might be willing to respond to the data; at times we will want to respond to the forecast. Sometimes we may have the confidence to implement level-based rules; sometimes we may want to be more cautious along the lines of change rules. Whether we're prepared to be more aggressive or more cautious in responding to changes in the output gap may also depend upon initial conditions, in particular where we are relative to the range of estimates of the output gap. The question remains how to apply the insights from this work. I don't find appealing the change or growth rule offered by Orphanides. It suggests that we raise the funds rate when growth is above trend, then lower the funds rate when growth falls back to trend. Given that the underlying model implies that inflation depends on utilization rates and not growth, the change rule does not seem like a sensible strategy to me. It implies raising the funds rate when the utilization rate is rising, then lowering the funds 6/29-30/99                                     95 rate when the utilization rate stabilizes at the higher level. The problem is that it's difficult to design a sensible rule in the face of uncertainty if constrained to linear rules. The rule I suggested at previous meetings is a nonlinear one. It allows for a downweighting of the response to the output gap when the gap is in a range around the best estimate, but for a sharper response once the gap has increased to the point where one is more confident that the economy has moved beyond the level of sustainable capacity. This is consistent with the sensible view that we should be cautious about fine- tuning, interpreted to mean aggressive responses to small changes relative to our targets. But we should recognize the gains of \\\"crude-tuning,\\\" interpreted as more aggressive responses to changes in output once output has moved farther away from the target. Applying this nonlinear rule to today's decisions would imply returning toward, but not all the way to, the simple Taylor rule prescription. A 50 basis point increase in the funds rate implemented over the next few meetings would, for example, be consistent with a halving of the response parameter of the output gap in a simple Taylor rule. But my nonlinear rule would also call for returning to a more aggressive response to further increases in the output gap going forward, given that the unemployment rate is already so low relative to estimates of NAIRU. A 25 basis point move today could be viewed as a partial reversal of the ease that was implemented last fall, in effect a partial return to a level-based Taylor rule. This is also consistent with a preemptive effort to limit the upward trend in inflation that appears likely to emerge going forward. Let me emphasize a consideration favoring the second move, if it's to be made, at the next meeting or two as opposed to later in the year. My presumption is that we will be disinclined to tighten after October through the end of the year because of possible volatility in financial markets related to Y2K and to shifts in the demand for liquidity. While a move in November is certainly not out of the question, I suspect we will be reluctant to take such action. Now, I think the decision about whether or not to retain an asymmetric directive today is somewhat less important in light of the fact that there will be an announcement, presumably, if we raise the funds rate. We can use this announcement to convey our sense of the balance of risks. Nevertheless, I have a preference for an asymmetric directive. 6/29-30/99                                   96 Let me note, however, that I think we are likely to encounter problems whether we opt for a symmetric or an asymmetric directive. If we return to a symmetric directive, the markets are likely to interpret today's move as the one and only one that we expect to make this year, unless they doubt we really mean a symmetric directive. As a result, market participants will revise downward their expectations about the funds rate in coming months, resulting in a rally in the bond and equity markets. I would prefer a more market neutral result. We could try to achieve this by combining a symmetric directive with asymmetric language in the announcement, but that seems destined to look confused as well as to confuse. If we choose an asymmetric directive, on the other hand, we could feed the anxiety in the markets about an even larger set of increases than the 50 basis points I expect to be appropriate. In addition, we want to keep our options open for a further rate increase as we assess the data over the next couple of months, rather than definitively signal that it's a sure thing My preference is for an asymmetric directive with a somewhat calming announcement, followed by a return to a symmetric directive after the second move--if we opt for a second move. This has the advantage of conveying the most useful information to the markets about our intentions and of being truthful. An added benefit is that moving to a symmetric directive after the second move would be a very effective way of signaling that we do not expect further near-term moves. It would be less informative if we moved to a symmetric directive today and then raised rates in August or October. Governor Gramlich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am at least a modified new economy kind of guy. I have argued in the past here that there is reason to believe that we have had a shift up in productivity and a shift down in NAIRU. The staff models have incorporated this and, as I said yesterday, I'd be willing to take their modification as probabilistically accurate. I read the materials carefully over the weekend and I concluded that a 50 basis point increase was appropriate. When Don Kohn circulated the Orphanides paper, I probably had a perverse reaction to it because it reminded me of the 1960s, and I think I'm haunted by that. We 6/29-30/99                                   97 let inflation get out of control then; we got behind in the game. And I certainly don't want to do that again. I'm sorry that Alice Rivlin can't be here for what I'm about to say next. We often talked about making the FOMC meeting more like a meeting--that is, not having canned remarks so much but actually having an interchange of ideas. I will say in that light that, frankly, you've all talked me out of a 50 basis point change. The discussion yesterday was less hawkish than I would have imagined. A number of you surprised me in what you said. The Chairman had a couple of bites at the apple, and he eroded my faith in the 50 a little bit each time. So I'm now okay with 25. Frankly, I don't see a huge difference between 25 basis points with symmetry and somewhat hawkish talk versus 25 basis points with asymmetry and some language in our announcement that says this is not the start of a 300 basis point increase or something on that order. It's hard for me to be certain, but my uninformed understanding of markets is that they tend to evolve to reflect what people say over time. There will be an announcement today. There will be future testimony. So I don't have a huge preference on that issue. I suppose I'm a bit on Larry Meyer's side of that because every time I've tried to slice baloney I've cut my thumb! So I'd rather do it in a fairly simply way. But the other could work, so I'm certainly not going to dissent from that. I want to say a few things about the FOMC, though. My main point is that, whatever we do today, I think we are placing a lot of importance on future data. So we have to be very careful that we are alert to respond if our present uncertainty gets resolved in one way or another, as indeed we responded last fall. I think we have to repeat that vigilance and readiness to respond now. Along that line let me make two suggestions on things we might do. One is--and this may violate some traditions I'm not aware of--that I actually liked the experience last fall with intermeeting changes and, since we all have telephones, we might want to do more of that. That might cut some of the wind out of the Fed-watching industry, which I think we would all favor. The second is that lots of times in our meetings people have come up with new indicators that we ought to look at that don't quite suggest what some of the other indicators have suggested. The Chairman does this more than anybody else, but 6/29-30/99                                      98 everybody does it to some degree. I wonder if it would be possible to give some thought to having the staff track information on what I'll call \\\"leading indicators of inflation\\\" and circulate it to the Committee. One thing that might be in it is the unit cost number that the Chairman just talked about; another is this modified unemployment rate, which includes discouraged workers in the calculation of the unemployment rate. There are various kinds of price indices that might be leading indicators of what could happen with what are known as the headline price indices. If we had all of those made available to us on a very current basis, first of all we would all be more informed and, secondly, we'd tend to be more on the same page. Therefore, when we get together and think about what is going on, there would be less chance of being surprised with new information at the meeting that we hadn't really thought about. So I would put on the table the suggestion that we might improve our process, if you will, in that way. I'd like to see the staff give some thought to that. Thank you. President Broaddus. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully but strongly would oppose the move back to symmetric directive language. If I read market expectations at all accurately, I think market participants are widely expecting the  point move and they are also expecting a further move of at least  point in the not too distant future. So if we change the directive language to symmetry, in effect we are going to be changing those expectations. Since we are now announcing the tilt under our new procedures, I think it is going to be very difficult to do so in a statement along the lines that Don Kohn suggested. I respect his point of view, but I'm just not at all sure that the language of the statement that we issue is going to offset the fact that we moved to symmetry. So to me it's a credibility issue. When I heard you suggest earlier what your own expectations are, what I heard is in my view best described as asymmetry toward tightness. I think as a matter of credibility we need to report that. More fundamentally, I think a  point increase combined with a change in the directive language is just not strong enough in the current situation, even given the points that you made in your comments. Actually, I was thinking that the question might come down to whether to do 50 basis points with symmetry or asymmetry. I had decided on 6/29-30/99                                   99 the basis of this kind of logic that even if we did 50, it might be misleading to have a change of language to symmetry. If I may, let me make some comments on the Orphanides paper. I thought we were going to have a more extended go-around about that, but I would just make a couple of comments because I don't think they are unrelated to the short-run issue. First of all, I thought the Orphanides paper was extremely interesting; it was one of the most enjoyable staff papers I've read in a long time, and I think it's very useful in many respects. Apart from the particular policy conclusions it suggests, I think it could make an even broader contribution if it led us to evaluate, on a more systematic basis, our past decisions and actions retrospectively. The military, for example, have been doing this for years. They devote a lot of resources--time, money, and personnel--to trying to learn systematically from their experience, and I think we ought to consider doing the same thing. After all, monetary policy is not unlike a military campaign. It involves strategy, tactics, uncertain information, and a rapidly changing environment. And the stakes are very high. I think a good way to approach this would be to develop some additional real time series and also to start routinely keeping real time data going forward. Some of that is already going on in the System. But if we were to do the kind of thing I have in mind, I think it would have to be centered here at the Board. With regard to the paper's specifics, Orphanides shows that real time output gap data are subject to significant measurement problems. And he concludes that we should reduce the weight that we give that data, or more fundamentally that we should move the funds rate only very cautiously in reaction to incoming data on the output gap. That would mean, in the context of the paper, that we would react primarily to deviations of actual inflation above an inflation target. But arguably--and this is really the simple point I want to make--our main policy successes in the 1980s and 1990s have come when we have acted more preemptively. The go/stop cycles that all of us remember in the 1960s and 1970s were, in my view at least, often the result of not reacting aggressively enough to early signs of rising inflation pressures. If there are problems with the output gap, then maybe we could find some other variable--some forward-looking measure of inflation expectations--to use in this context, if we use that sort of rule, such as survey information 6/29-30/99                                     100 or bond rates. So it may be a good exercise to take on to see if we could develop some of these real time data series to see how a Taylor rule would work with those. Finally, I'd like to point out a deficiency in the Taylor rule as I see it; I think it is fundamentally the one identified in the Orphanides paper. And that is that the rule suggests that we only need to move the real funds rate away from a fixed constant, given by the historical average, if in fact an output gap or an inflation gap arises. But as Larry Meyer suggested earlier, even if these gaps were zero, macroeconomic developments can make it necessary for real short rates to move and for us to follow and accommodate those rate changes. An example, one Larry cited earlier--and I've made this point in some previous meetings--is that an increase in trend productivity growth means that real short rates need to rise. Just to repeat, the reason is that households and businesses would want to borrow against their perception of higher future income now in order to increase current consumption and investment before it's actually available. So the rate needs to rise to induce those consumers and business to defer that spending until in fact the output is available. The Taylor rule doesn't give any attention to that kind of real business cycle reason for a move in rates. It only allows reaction to inflation gaps and output gaps. So bottom line, while I really enjoyed reading this paper and I think it was extremely valuable, I'm not entirely comfortable with what I see as one of its major implications, which is that this Committee should be even more circumspect than it is now in moving the funds rate. I believe a case can be made that just the opposite is true. And then we can get rid of this situation where we have 500 reporters and 600 cameras around this building when we have one of these meetings! Thank you. President Jordan. Thank you. I certainly agree that a move today is appropriate. As far as the strength of the action and the way it's interpreted, I'd prefer to do that with or without discount rate increases. Since I believe that a stronger action now is appropriate, I hope the Board will consider the issue of the discount rate on behalf of my directors anyway. Unlike Al Broaddus, though, I'm going to disagree on the issue of the symmetry. I favor a permanent move to a symmetric directive. [Laughter] I might buy that! 6/29-30/99                                    101 The happy state of affairs is one where the collective view of the group, when we meet, is that the risks are in fact balanced. I prefer symmetry in our behavior more than in our words, and it troubles me when there's asymmetry in our behavior with or without asymmetry in our words. Last fall, when the opinion of the Committee shifted toward the view that the risks were on the downside, we moved very promptly over a fairly short period of time to a position where the collective judgment of the Committee was that the risks were in fact balanced. I think we should be symmetric about that on the upside as well. When the collective view of the Committee is that the risks are on the upside, we should move as promptly, at meetings or between meetings, to get back to where we feel that the risks are balanced. As far as the announcement of symmetry/asymmetry, I think Professor Eisenberg has bitten again, or as the British would say \\\"Goodhart's law has hit us again.\\\" We and most other central banks have known that announcing exchange rate targets or levels or something of that nature is a rather foolish thing to do; it comes back to haunt us. We have learned with monetary targeting that if the wisdom of the market is that they know the trigger point--that if some growth rate of some money measure is epsilon above or below a certain level, that is going to trigger a policy action--it isn't going to work. That's because it doesn't elicit the behavior in the marketplace that would occur if they didn't know what the trigger was. Imagine the absurdity if we were to announce this afternoon that the Committee voted today to raise the funds rate  point at its next meeting on August 24 and, therefore, we plan to save the airfare and the travel time and just not show up then because we've already decided we are going to do that. Well, that's rather absurd. So I think announcing something that is interpreted by the market as meaning that we have already decided to raise rates at our next meeting, as I think the May announcement was interpreted, gets us into an undesirable position. I can tell you already that I don't want to go into the October 5 meeting with a predisposition to raise rates because I don't want to be blamed for the crash of the stock market in October! [Laughter] I also know that I want to get to the December meeting--and possibly even the November meeting, but I'm much more certain about the December meeting--clearly feeling that the risks are balanced. If anything, we ought to feel that we have as much chance of lowering rates as 6/29-30/99                                   102 raising them once we get to December and into the next year. We ought to be ready to go in either direction. We know there's going to come a time when things will again be changing rapidly in a downward direction, and I would prefer to enter that environment with the risks in balance. We do not have balanced risks right now. I think we need to get to a position where we're comfortable that the risks are symmetric as soon as we can. President Boehne. I think we do need to raise the funds rate 25 basis points today. It seems to me that we are largely boxed in by our rhetoric and we ought to do it and get this episode behind us. There is a reasonable economic rationale for this, given the uncertainty that we're facing, and that is a \\\"take-back\\\" rationale from last fall, with financial markets and the rest of the world doing better. But I think we want to leave open the question of how much of a take-back we need to do. It may be 25, it may be 50, or it may be 75. Who knows? I think we ought to shift the focus back to the economy and back to the data that come in. If, for example, we become more confident about productivity increases, if we have a continuation of the pattern of prices and wages that has prevailed over the past several years, then 25 may be fine. If, on the other hand, we become less confident of the productivity increases and we begin to see some early warning signs that inflation is picking up, then we are going to have to do more. And we ought to do more in those situations. As for the tilt, I think we ought to go back to a symmetric directive today. We need to calm things down. We need to shift the public's emphasis away from psychoanalyzing this Committee and back to the economy; in my view a symmetric directive would help do that. Announcing the tilt, at least in this initial experiment, turned out to be a cruder instrument than I think we had anticipated, largely because of the interaction of rhetoric. At this point we just don't know enough to say how much, or if, we have to raise rates further, and therefore we shouldn't box ourselves in for the future. We ought to see how reality plays out and go from there. President Parry. Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation for a 25 basis point increase. I would favor asymmetry because I think it more correctly reflects what I 6/29-30/99                                      103 believe the risks are to the outlook and policy. I would be against symmetry because I fear first of all that, in itself, it doesn't correctly reflect our assessment of the risks. Secondly, I am also concerned that it would be misinterpreted by the market. Obviously a statement accompanying symmetry could clarify things and indicate why the risks are not really symmetrical. But if we are going to go that route, even Jerry Jordan's recommendation becomes more attractive to me. And I really begin to wonder whether referring to symmetry accomplishes anything. Governor Ferguson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support your recommendation for a 25 basis point tightening at this stage. We are in a period of some uncertainty and we should weigh the data a little more heavily than the forecast. I think the data support a small move. The forecast, with a 50 basis point increase built in, is perhaps indicative of the need for a further move, but it's not mandatory today based on what we know. I think there is also some evidence that because of the high wealth-to- income ratio and also a larger share of imports in GDP that we may have a more powerful tool here than we thought. That is something Alice Rivlin raised when she was sitting in that seat a few meetings ago. As to the question of the tilt, I have a slight preference for maintaining the asymmetric tilt. I'm concerned that if we raise rates and go to symmetry and then put out a somewhat hawkish message saying we're still leaning in that direction, we will create more rather than less of a tendency to psychoanalyze what the 17 or 18 of us are thinking. Frankly, in my ideal world what we would have is a decision, a tilt announcement, and complete silence from the Committee. We are not going to get there, but I think we at least ought to continue the process of trying to help markets understand what these tilts do or do not mean. I'm concerned about creating another tool in the form of a well crafted legal/economic document that will give the market something else to chew over. This is obviously not a strong point of view, and if we go to symmetry with a well-crafted announcement by Don Kohn, I will applaud Don's efforts and try to get him something for his gray hair! But I don't think that's the better way to deal with the situation at this stage. President Hoenig. 6/29-30/99                                    104 Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation. I came into this meeting wanting at least a discussion of a 50 basis point increase, and I got that, which I appreciate very much. It was very helpful. Along those lines and in listening to you, my assessment has been shaded in terms of the issue--the issue being the degree and the durability of productivity improvements that we're all trying to decipher. So, I would go with the 25 basis points. It is a move up, which I think is appropriate. And it represents a continuation of the gradualist approach on which we have built a pretty high degree of credibility over time, and that has served us well. Given all that, I would very strongly support a symmetric directive for this meeting. I believe it represents the consensus of the FOMC and I don't think we should be anticipating the next move until one of two things happens--either we get new information that addresses some of the earlier issues you raised, or we as a group have a change in judgment. If either occurs, then we can change the rate again in the intermeeting period or at the next meeting. I think that is the right approach in terms of dealing with the market and the information we share. President Guynn. Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation of a point tightening. My thoughts on symmetry mirror Bob Parry's very closely and the views Larry Meyer and Al Broaddus expressed earlier. I judge the sentiment around the table, certainly my own, as a judgment that one 25 basis point tightening is probably not enough to deal with what is likely to be coming. So I still think the probability of our needing to tighten further is fairly high. To me it is more intellectually honest and more credible to go ahead and tell people that, rather than to try to back into it with a symmetric directive. I also am afraid that moving back to symmetry mutes our policy move and makes it too timid. My two-year-old granddaughter when she finishes eating says \\\"all done\\\" and has this cute hand signal to say she's finished. I am afraid that not only financial markets but lenders, builders, and others will get the sense that we saw the need to tighten further as only a tiny threat and will quit helping us in trying to lean against what we see coming. Also, to me, moving back to symmetry suggests that we're smart enough to 6/29-30/99                                   105 make one small  point tightening move and fine-tune with a precision that I don't think we have. Finally, I'm concerned, despite the reminders that we frequently have made a policy move from symmetry, about the view that we can tell markets \\\"so be it\\\" if we decide we need to move. Just as we have created a new device with the symmetry/ asymmetry announcement, I think we have created--either intentionally or unintentionally --an expectation that we will try very hard, perhaps harder than in the past, to let people know where we are headed. I am concerned that even though the data may begin to nudge us in the direction of additional tightening, we may want to cycle back through and move to an asymmetric directive and then to a tightening move later. That would push the move to later in the year than is necessary and--as Larry Meyer reminded us and as I said at the last meeting--will get us into the period when I suspect we will prefer not to be meddling in markets while the Y2K situation is in play. So I would have at least a modest preference for an asymmetric directive. President Poole. Mr. Chairman, I support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. I think the issue on symmetry is complicated by the fact that the language in the directive refers explicitly to the intermeeting period. The sentiment around the table seems to be that we may or may not need an increase in the intermeeting period or at the next meeting; I think that's the way the markets are going to interpret symmetry. But the sentiment around the table is that, more likely than not, we are going to need some increases later in the year, perhaps at the next meeting or sometime later. So I think the problem is that we are getting into a box with the precise wording of that symmetry clause. If it's confined strictly to the intermeeting period and if we can make that clear in what we say, then it seems to me that a symmetrical directive is probably appropriate. I don't think we want to give a firm signal that we are rather confident that we will need to increase rates before or at the next meeting. My judgment, in reading what people said around the table, is that we are not confident about that. I would very much defer to your desires in how you want to craft the directive language and the associated wording of the press release. 6/29-30/99                                   106 Getting away from the issue of the wording--which is a very important issue and I'm not trying to belittle it at all--I certainly count myself among those who believe that the Phillips curve is an unreliable policy guide. What that means is that the predictive content for the inflation rate--and I'll emphasize the \\\"predictive\\\"--of the estimated employment gap or GDP gap, however you want to put it, seems to be very low. But having said that, it is still true that we must somehow regulate the thrust of monetary policy to keep it in line with the economy's capacity to produce goods. We can't get away from that underlying responsibility of trying to match the monetary thrust with the economy's capacity to produce. If it is true that output growth and employment provide little insight into the inflation rate in the short run, this Phillips curve idea, then I also want to emphasize that the converse is also true--that the inflation rate does not have predictive content for employment and growth. We believe the proposition that as a long-run matter the inflation rate can settle wherever it might be more or less independently of the unemployment rate. But we can't have it both ways. We can't believe, it seems to me, that the Phillips curve works only in one direction or that it doesn't work in one direction. If there's no content in one direction, there's no content in the other direction either. That leads me to emphasize that we should not believe that a monetary policy thrust designed to yield, let's say, a lower rate of inflation is going to have any predictable implication for employment and growth. I have no doubt that a highly restrictive policy could tank the economy. I think we all believe that we can take the economy by surprise and we could produce a significant downturn by making a mistake. But I continue to believe that that's not the likely course of events. I think the greater risk to employment is that inflation will drift up and will drift up to the point where it will unsettle market expectations, and that will put us in the box of saying we just can't allow this to continue. We will get ourselves off on one side and market expectations will be destabilized. So I believe that the greater risk to employment stems precisely from a drifting up of inflation. That is my reading on that. I'd like to make a suggestion about the directive language. It seems to me that in the general paragraph of the directive--I'm referring to the version called the draft 6/29-30/99                                   107 directive which has a brown cover--we ought not to be implying in any way that we are opposed to high employment and high growth. So I would suggest that we move the language on inflation, which is in lines 13 to 17, up to the front so that when we talk about the state of the economy we put the inflation discussion first. I'm looking at this draft that was sent around to us with line numbers on it. Which line numbers? The document begins with \\\"the general paragraph,\\\" which says: \\\"The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a continued vigorous expansion in economic activity.\\\" In other words, we start off by talking about economic activity. What I'm suggesting is that we start off by talking about the inflation environment. The wording can't be moved exactly the way it is written there, but the language about inflation is down in lines 13 to 17. I'd emphasize that our concern is with inflation rather than have the very first thing in this directive be a commentary on the growth of the economy. I understand very well that there may be a problem changing the wording of something like this on very short notice. But I would like to throw out for consideration anyway trying to change the thrust of this so it doesn't look as though somehow we are opposed to vigorous growth by starting right off the bat with that as an observation about the economy. Let me make a suggestion. Clearly, we can't do it now because it will create a problem. Right. Why don't you write a memorandum and give it to Don Kohn. He will circulate it to the rest of the Committee and will collect comments. If there is sufficient support for your position, we could bring it to the next meeting for determination. Is that satisfactory? Absolutely. In the press release for this meeting, if there is a press release, we could put the emphasis on inflation and productivity growth and the uncertainties about them ahead of the discussion of the real economy. Anyway, I throw that out just as a possibility. Let me say that I continue to believe that greater clarity in our inflation objective would be constructive. I talked about this a couple of meetings ago. I'm not going to say 6/29-30/99                                    108 that there's a convincing case that a CPI of 1 percent for the year is going to yield a better economic performance than a CPI of 2 percent. But I do believe that uncertainty about that matter is worth in the end 100 basis points in long bonds, whether we settle at 1 or 2 percent. I think most people would say that uncertainty that adds 100 basis points to market interest rates is going to affect the way the economy works. So I continue to believe that more clarity about what our real objective is in that area would be useful. In terms of the market discussion about our policy and the language used last time, the disclosure of the asymmetry--the way I would like to put it in Wall Street language--means that \\\"the fed funds rate is now in play.\\\" There was a period in which it was pretty stable and now it is in play. The whole issue is up in the air and that's going to be true until things seem to settle down and the rate settles down. The ideal situation would be that both we and the market draw the same conclusions from the incoming data about what actions are necessary to be consistent with low inflation. That is the sort of expectational equilibrium that we would most like. I believe the right way to handle this process is to be sure that the market is very clear about our objectives and about our willingness to act to achieve those objectives. As the data arrive on both the real economy and the inflation rate and on productivity and everything else we look at, we would hope that the market would come to the same judgments as we would about how to interpret that data. The hope is that we're not just looking at ourselves in the mirror when we try to assess market reactions to the data. We should try to give to the markets a sense that we're all in this together in terms of trying to make sense out of the incoming flow of data and that we don't have an absolute conviction by any means about where all of this is going to take us. That is, we don't have a conviction about how much the federal funds rate is going to have to move or even in which direction necessarily. Given that we're not very far off of the right place to be, we think the rate is going to depend on how the data come in. I have a mild preference for an asymmetric directive, I suppose, because I think it accurately describes the tenor of the Committee's feelings about this. But I think also that we need to have some discussion that emphasizes to the market that asymmetry 6/29-30/99                                     109 should not be interpreted as a forecast of an automatic 25 basis point increase at the next meeting independently of what happens. President Stern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, favor a point increase in the fed funds rate. I think it's appropriate economically and the markets are prepared for it. As far as the question of symmetry is concerned, I am on this issue where I usually am, which is that I have a deep-seated, built-in bias toward symmetry. So, I feel that way this time. My preference is simply to assess the incoming information and act if action is appropriate. If we want to accompany that with some semi-hawkish language about how we view the prospects, that's fine with me. But I must admit I'm not at all sure how the market will take that or any other statement. It seems to me that it's shorthand to say that the market is simply trying to psychoanalyze the Fed and guess what's going to happen next. Another way of saying that, along the lines Bill Poole talked about, is that they're looking at the same information we're looking at and they're trying to piece it together and understand what it means for prospective economic performance, monetary policy actions, and so on. Maybe the effort to do that has become more intense. But even if that's true, this won't be the first time there has been a lot of intensity in that effort. President McTeer. We don't know and can't know what is over the horizon. Inflation may be on the verge of accelerating or it may not be. Certainly a strong case can be made that it is. But a similarly strong case could have been made this time last year and this time the year before. Had we tried to enforce the speed limit based on contemporaneous estimates of NAIRU over these last few years, we would most likely not today have inflation under 2 percent and unemployment near 4 percent. I'd hate to see us lose our nerve at this point and risk bringing the experiment to a premature end. I'd rather continue to test the growth limits of the new economy unmodified. But if we have to have a modest tightening, I hope it can be accompanied by a return to a neutral bias to take some of the nervousness out of financial markets. That was the statement I wrote just before you talked earlier, Mr. Chairman. Here's what I wrote afterwards. [Laughter] This is just a shorter version of the same thing: For reasons that you 6/29-30/99                                   110 described so eloquently a while ago, I would prefer to keep our foot off the brake and continue to test the limits of the new economy that you described. Your comments led me to believe that if the Committee were not boxed in, you would have recommended at this meeting no change in the fed funds rate. Therefore, to get out of the box, we should adopt an unbiased directive at this meeting and, as Ed Boehne put it, calm things down. Longer term we may want to revisit my earlier suggestion that we stop voting on a directive bias or Jerry Jordan's alternative that we make a permanent move to a symmetric directive. President Moskow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have just a few comments on the longer term. First, I too was very impressed by the discussion we had at our board meeting of the Chicago and Detroit directors when they gave their presentations about electronic commerce. We did it a little differently. We divided the board ahead of time into groups on banking, services, retail, and manufacturing--we had done a background paper for them ahead of time as well--and then they organized the presentations themselves. Many of them did a lot of work preparing for them and I think the presentations really were very enlightening. I came away from that discussion, and from other things that I have read and heard in talking to people about this, with the feeling that something profound is clearly happening in electronic commerce and its impact on firms. I just don't know how significant it is in terms of its impact on the economy. It's an area where we are all learning and we're going to continue to learn in the coming months and years. And I look forward to studying in more detail your very helpful comments at this meeting. As for the decision today, I certainly agree with the 25 basis point increase. On the tilt, I think it's a very close call. I thought the earlier discussion with Don Kohn and your comments, Mr. Chairman, were very helpful. I think we are somewhere between the full tilt and symmetry at this point. On balance, I come back to the point I mentioned before: that our credibility--or more specifically, your credibility--is extremely important and at this point it's extremely high, too. So, I would defer to you on this question. But my preference would be for asymmetry. Under the current circumstances I think 25 basis points and no tilt will be misinterpreted unless accompanied by a very strong statement 6/29-30/99                                   111 and strong language in your testimony. Even then, it still may be misinterpreted as \\\"that's it,\\\" as I believe Jack Guynn said. So, I prefer the asymmetric directive but I will defer to you on this. On the question of the tilt itself, I think we clearly have some learning to do before we know how to use this new tool effectively. To quote you, Mr. Chairman, this is one area where we're engaged in \\\"on-the-job training.\\\" It's a new tool and we're in a new environment. We have tightened before from symmetrical directives, but this is new. I recall your mentioning at a meeting several years ago that back in 1994 when you were planning to start a series of tightening moves, you had a great deal of difficulty signaling that intention to the market at that time. Clearly, there's no difficulty today in that type of signaling. We've said that we are going to be more transparent with this tool. If we go with symmetry, I view that as being less transparent. That's my own personal view. In my mind there are questions about the usefulness of the tilt itself. Just listening to the discussion around the table today, it's clear that there are very wide differences among the members of this Committee as to exactly what the tilt means. If we keep the tool in place, I think we will be using it a lot less than we did before, as was predicted last year when we discussed this. I think the conversation around the room is making us more Jordanian than we had been. President Minehan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have thought for some time that we needed to take back at least a portion, if not all, of the ease in monetary policy that we enacted last fall in the face of chaotic financial markets. Certainly, the prospects for external growth, the fact that we have not yet seen a rise in inflation, and that some of the temporary factors that have been keeping it at bay are unwinding give me even more cause to think that we should unwind that easing in monetary policy. So the question today for me was not whether to tighten but how much to tighten. I know there's a great deal of uncertainty now and I accept the point of the research on this subject, which is that the more uncertain we are the more slowly we should move, taking time to assess things. That strikes me, as others have said, as rather intuitive. Now, both the Greenbook and our own forecast suggest that at least 50 to 75 basis points of tightening are needed this year just to keep a lid on inflation in 2000. Keeping 6/29-30/99                                   112 the lid on inflation thereafter will require much more, as the longer-run analyses suggest. It's true that these analyses are done in a traditional way, using the traditional constructs of most of our models, and they are subject to a lot of uncertainty. They incorporate some estimates of the output gap; they incorporate a revision to trend productivity; and they also incorporate assumptions about NAIRU. Some people would debate the validity of this structure. Certainly, if we continue to have accelerating productivity growth, these estimates of output gap and NAIRU and so forth may be wrong. But in a time of uncertainty, it certainly seems that relying on constructs that have helped us bring about nearly 20 years of better economic conditions--milder cyclical turns, ever lower inflation, lower unemployment, and more sustained growth--has validity. It seems appropriate to look back on the things that have helped us create the kind of environment that President McDonough referred to, one in which more people are working, more people have that experience of working, and the benefits of growth are shared more fully by all. I think the argument really turns on whether we want that environment to continue. If we want it to continue in a way that extends the experience of those 20 years, then we need to be careful in containing inflation and in following the constructs that have helped us get where we are. So, assuming monetary policy should be forward-looking even in a time of uncertainty, we do need to tighten policy now. I agree with the proposal for 25 basis points. The next question is what to say about it. Based on the analysis both in the Greenbook forecast and in our own forecast, I do think we are likely to need to do more. In that regard, I favor keeping an asymmetric directive. Jack Guynn outlined all of the many reasons why I think asymmetry makes more sense at this time. I wonder whether what we're seeing now in terms of the market reaction to what we've said about our tilt is as much a reaction to the change that we've introduced in announcing the tilt as it is to anything else. Over time, as market participants get used to our announcing this and moving or not moving at the next meeting, I wonder if their reactions are going to calm down considerably; perhaps as we get used to it the market will get used to it as well. In my view one of the reasons we decided to do this was to improve information to the market from the Committee itself rather than from disparate members of the Committee. In that regard, the premium is on honesty. In order to be 6/29-30/99                                  113 honest about what I feel the course of future actions should be, the directive should be asymmetric. Finally, to reiterate another point that I believe Jack Guynn mentioned, 25 basis points, no tilt, but some hawkish language, as has been suggested, may well create a bigger market reaction when all that comes out. There will be more uncertainty about how we're using this language. Frankly, without an asymmetric tilt, I think we're likely to see the market get ahead of itself--experience a somewhat euphoric increase, thinking that we are not engaged in the kind of tightening that I believe most people think is necessary. Thank you. As I read the Committee, we're strongly in support of a 25 basis point increase and modestly in support of symmetry. So I would suggest that we read the directive in that context and then proceed to vote. This time we're on page 22 of the Bluebook, at the bottom of the page: \\\"To promote the Committee's long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds rate operating objective during the intermeeting period.\\\" Let's vote.  Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman McDonough Yes President Boehne Yes Governor Ferguson Yes Governor Gramlich Yes Governor Kelley Yes President McTeer No Governor Meyer Yes President Moskow Yes President Stern Yes 6/29-30/99                                       114 I have drafts of a number of different announcements concerning this decision, and I'll read the one that I think most closely reflects the Committee's views: The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. Last fall the Committee reduced interest rates to counter a significant seizing- up of financial markets in the United States. Since then much of the financial strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed, and economic activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is judged no longer necessary. Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures . Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action. The Committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth. Is that wording satisfactory? I think that's good. SEVERAL. Yes. Okay. A Nobel prize for Don Kohn! Yes. We're early for lunch, but coffee is available. [Laughter] August 24 is the date of the next meeting.\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone. Would somebody like to start us off by approving the minutes? Without objection. Bill McDonough, would you start off please? Good morning, Mr. Chairman, ladies, gentlemen.  [Statement--see Appendix.] I think it's apparent that we're moving in the direction that the Committee very strongly urged in the last year or two.  My own personal impression is that we should move in the direction in which [Bundesbank Vice President] Tietmeyer is suggesting with regard to selling U.S. holdings of marks. The second question that you raised, namely the balance of what we have in our portfolio, is really quite important to address because I get the impression-- indeed, I'm sure--that no coherent mechanism was employed in accumulating these foreign balances in a manner that was in any way related to what was a rational portfolio for long-term intervention purposes. Now that we're finally getting to the point where we're slimming down toward a reasonable aggregative level, it's probably wise to put back on the table what in fact should be the long-term-- both strategic and tactical--position of the Foreign Desk. And I think it might be useful to have some recommendations coming from you in that regard. Certainly. I open up the meeting to questions with the specific hope that each member will use the occasion to indicate whether he or she is still on board with the position that we have taken to streamline significantly the aggregative holdings that we had as of a year or two ago.  Who would like to start off? I think there's an opportunity to move further in the direction that we want to go, and I concur that once we're closer to where we want to be it will be worth thinking [more precisely] about what that position should be. I concur with Mr. Syron. I not only concur, but I really want to express appreciation for Bill McDonough's capturing the spirit of the Board and the FOMC position and very well representing that.  It's very comforting to me to know the direction we're going, and I've had time to worry about other things! Does anybody have any questions? I have no problem with the broad direction we're going, and I completely agree with the point on the structure of the balances. But I have to say on the D-mark balance itself that if I extrapolate out this next $10 billion, I do have a 5/19/92 nagging sense of uneasiness that we might be getting to the point where there's some danger of being too thin. We still have $20 billion DM. Not after the next [transaction], i.e. the further sales proposed by Tietmeyer. It would leave about $14.7 billion equivalent in DM after the next transaction, which would be about 24 billion deutschemarks. Bill is using dollar equivalent figures and combined Treasury/Federal Reserve figures. That's at current exchange rates. I make this observation knowing, and I think broadly sharing, the sentiment of the Committee.  There probably are only a few of us who were around in the late '70s when we had to approach the world hat in hand [to obtain needed foreign currency balances], and that was a very uncomfortable feeling. I would not like to find us in that position again. Well, I think we still have a very large block of holdings. I agree with what you're saying. I just want introduce a little element of caution, that's all. Caution noted. It's worthwhile for us to give some thought as to what is the appropriate balance, where we should start and stop, and how far we should go.  I know that's difficult, but as we move forward I think that's something that we should start to confront. Mr. Chairman, I agree fully. I've never had very much sympathy for intervention, but I do remember the days that Jerry has alluded to when we had to draw on the swaps to get money to support the dollar. And if we are going to continue [to intervene], which I hope we won't, our holdings could come in useful, as he says. But I have never been sympathetic toward intervention and I'm glad we're going in the direction we're going. Does anybody else want to express an opinion or raise a question? I'm new to the process and didn't participate in your discussions before, but I like the direction. The desirable level, I think, is so far below $20 billion deutschemarks that I'm perfectly comfortable with getting down there. If there are no further comments, I believe the content of what I just heard indicates that Bill ought to go ahead and see whether or not he can formulate the appropriate longer-term strategy. I guess the next meeting would not be an inappropriate time to resurface this.  If there are no further 5/19/92 questions, I'll take a motion on ratifying--no, we don't have to ratify anything. Let's move on to the Domestic Desk, Peter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--see Appendix.] Questions for Peter? Mr. Chairman, as you are generally aware, I wanted to bring to the Committee's attention the fact that the multiple investigations of the Salomon Brothers incident from last summer may be coming to a head in the near future.  I say \\\"may\\\" because this is a very complex matter and things could change even at the eleventh hour.  I don't think I can characterize the bottom line of that process except to say that a major effort is being made by all of the official agencies--the U.S. Attorney, the Justice Department, the SEC, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve--to act in a way that puts this unhappy event behind everybody in a coordinated fashion. As I said, any number of things could change, including the most obvious --the precise timing. But the specific issues of primary dealer status and the status of Salomon's relationship to the Treasury in a context of the bidding restrictions that they put on them last year will be addressed as well. The intention is to try to address those issues in a context that is consistent with the entirety of a solution. Again, I can't characterize the likely bottom line, because I still don't quite know what the pieces of that bottom line are, but I thought it important that the Committee be broadly aware that it seems likely, but by no means certain, that this could get put to bed in the near future. Any further questions for Peter or Jerry? You have to help me with my memory on this. As I recall from the last time this issue came up, if there was a felony involved in this, a suspension is automatic, isn't it? Well, first of all, Governor Lindsey, in the new guidelines there is a reference to the fact that if a firm pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a criminal charge, a sanction would follow automatically. However, in Congressional testimony we went to rather great lengths to say that that specific provision would not necessarily apply ex post to the Salomon situation. Therefore, even if a firm were not indicted for a criminal charge, we still would have the flexibility to impose a sanction even though that specific provision, which followed the event, is there. But we were quite clear in saying that we did not feel that we were necessarily bound by that in the context of the events of last August. Thank you for that information. If there are no further questions, I will entertain a motion to ratify the actions of the Domestic Desk since the March meeting. Is there a second? 5/19/92 Without objection. I'd like to make a recommendation on leeway for the next [intermeeting] period, Mr. Chairman. Sure, go ahead. [Statement--see Appendix.] Is there any objection? We'll assume the vote is in the affirmative. Let's move on to the economic discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--see Appendix.] Questions for Mr. Prell? Mike, you went through some of the risks to the forecast.   It seems to me that there are some areas where the economy could turn out somewhat better.   Some of the work we've done suggests that perhaps we could get greater strength in the residential sector. It's conceivable that the dollar may end up being somewhat weaker than was estimated in the forecast and then net exports would continue to be somewhat better as well.   And the equipment area could be stronger. And finally, inventories--though they are not likely to get back to a traditional relationship--could perhaps not change as much as seems to be implied in the forecast.   When you look at the risks, do you see a real symmetry of risks in this forecast or do you think there might be a predominance of risks on one side or the other?   What strikes me now as opposed to the [forecast at the time of the] prior FOMC meeting is that, at least in terms of visibility, there seem to be some upside risks that weren't there before. Well, we've felt that the balance of risks also was more even in the last couple of forecasts than it had been through much of last year. And I think we repeatedly flagged what we perceived to be the asymmetry of the probability distribution through last year. We are reasonably comfortable with this forecast as presenting fairly balanced risks.  I think each of the items that you mentioned is a plausible story. The one reservation I would have in light of the recent data is that the latest housing market data are disappointing relative to even our meager expectations.  We probably had about as low a forecast for second-quarter housing starts as anyone and yet the April figures--one month admittedly--do paint a weaker picture. Although rates have come down. Rates have come down and some observers sensed that people were beginning to look at home buying as they would look at car buying:  They had to feel there was a bargain. You know, the government offered rebates early in the year and people rushed to buy. We had not attached a lot of importance to that at the time, but in retrospect it may have pulled forward some housing starts from later 5/19/92 in the year, or certainly some home sales.      And we're not exactly sure where we are. So, you would say the risks still are relatively balanced? I think they're reasonably balanced here. President Black. Mike, in reading the Greenbook, I concluded that you thought the first-quarter GNP, or rather GDP--I haven't made that transition completely--increased at a 3 percent rate.  Then in reading the briefing papers last night, I thought at first you were going to say 3.3 percent but then I looked at the chart and it appeared that it might go as high as 4 percent. What is your best guess as to what that figure really might be? Let me give you the arithmetic [to the extent] that we are able to do these translations.  Every number that has come in since the BEA's initial estimate has been higher than they had anticipated, at least until the revision for the March housing starts, which had only a small impact. If you cumulate those figures, you come out at this point with about a 4 percent increase in GDP.  That's assuming that the merchandise trade figure comes in right on their assumption. It could be higher; it could be lower.   Our feeling was that all these additional goods being sold might be tilting the risks toward some lower [trade figure].  So, that's where we are, and I think it's a fair statement at this juncture. Now, BEA will confront the same anomalies that I noted, and they will have to take that into account. They have some room to maneuver, but I think we should expect a substantial revision. That really would be something of a surprise to the private economy if it were that much, wouldn't it? Indeed. It's looking backward, but I don't think everyone has caught up with this. I see that a number of private analysts have been talking in the last week or so about growth of around 3 percent, and they will probably refine that a bit.  So, it's unlikely to be a total shock, but it's coming in on the high side of expectations, well on the high side. Governor Lindsey. Mike, in the forecast you have an implicit decline in long nominal rates. Explicit decline! Explicit decline, excuse me! I forgot where it was in the Greenbook. Yet long rates seem to [be stuck in] a trading range; I think we all find them awfully stubborn. Suppose they stay in the same trading range. How much risk is there to the forecast if there is no decline over the next year in long rates? Well, I'm not sure how one would define the \\\"recent\\\" trading range. If you look at the period since early 5/19/92 February until recently, I think we're pressing against the lower limits [of that range] this morning, and we could conceivably break below that.  Looking at the broader time frame going back, with bond yields having gotten down to about 7-3/8 percent, that's about the dimension of the decline that we're anticipating in our forecast by early next year.  I think the answer to your question depends on what circumstances bring about this failure [of long rates to decline].   If it is a buoyant economy and strong demands for capital, then obviously it's not a problem. If it is higher inflation expectations, we get into some more complex issues about how that might affect the affordability of housing and so on; but if it's inflation expectations and not real rates, again it may not be a compelling negative.   If it's risk premia brought on by political uncertainties--and this may be a year of tremendous political uncertainty--or just the wrong expectations, as we've had on some occasions, that could be a negative. So it's really hard to say ex ante. May I follow up on that question? Sure, go ahead. In the Greenbook, Part 2, on page III-3 you list the indirect effects of Larry's question.   You say \\\"velocity rose further despite declines in opportunity costs. Recent weakness in M2 occurred in the face of still small opportunity costs.\\\"   You refer to a chart and so on.   But then I flip over to page III-5 in the paragraph at the top of the page where it says \\\"the lack of aggressive pricing for these deposits evidently has encouraged investors to move from retail CDs into stock and bond mutual funds in order to take advantage of higher anticipated returns.\\\"   That says, at least for some components of M2, that the real opportunity cost is not the short-term yield change in the chart on the prior page but rather these longer-term yields and that those components of M2 are more like investments instruments than they are like money instruments.   So, that paragraph says that you've got the wrong opportunity cost, at least for those components of money. Well, I think that's right. There are several Reserve Banks, including your own in particular, that have used other opportunity costs that took into account the intermediate- and longer- term time deposit rates.  And that does a little better. Although it doesn't pick up all the unexplained shortfall in money, it does help to explain it to some extent.  Now, it has always been the case that the division between money and investment assets--particularly for money after deregulation and after Reg Q was taken off NOW accounts-- is very hard to see.  It's hard to draw a bright line between something you would call money and something you would call investment assets. Other checkable deposits, NOW accounts, have elements of investment assets; people hold them because of rate expectations.   So, that has always been a somewhat fuzzy picture.   I agree that our measurement of opportunity costs probably could be improved.   I think one issue here is what that is telling us when banks aren't competing for these intermediate- and longer-term CDs.   It's telling us in part that they don't see loan demand; they don't intend to make a lot of loans out in the future. Then we have to go back and ask whether that means something:  whether it is just a relatively benign redirection of credit flows or whether it is saying something about the intermediation process that could feed back on aggregate demand.   So, 5/19/92 I agree with your point on opportunity costs; but once you cut below that point, it still leaves a lot of ambiguity about the meaning of the slowdown in money. But the reason for asking comes back to what Mike was saying [about whether] what the Greenbook says this month is right. The Greenbook says long bond yields have come down because of lower inflation; Mike termed that very appropriately [unintelligible] very hopeful outlook for 1993.  I'd like to believe it.  But the question was:  What are the risks to the forecast?  Can you connect up what is going on with these components of money and [say that] part of this optimistic outlook on inflation reflects the economy or is there something a little stronger than that to tie it to? Part of it, I assume, is also because of slow growth of M2.  Given this reason for slow growth of M2, how comfortable can you be with that? Well, let me just say that I think we noted in the last Greenbook, not this one, that we didn't find the narrower monetary aggregates nor the enhanced narrow monetary aggregate that you're implicitly describing as providing strong evidence on the outlook. Historically, we haven't found that these provide all that much better guidance than M2 as it is, with all of what I view as flaws in the logic of its construction. But I'd also argue that in telling the story about how money affects inflation, there's a short- run transmission mechanism which I think would run through the pressures of aggregate demand on aggregate supply. Thus, I think our assessment of the pressures in resource markets is very relevant to the short-run outlook for inflation through 1993.  So, I can segment these questions to some extent. With symmetric risks? Well, I guess I'm skeptical about the meaning of the monetary aggregates right now. I'm not inclined to assign a large asymmetry to the risk just because the monetary aggregates have been running low. Clearly, that's a judgment call.   Others have differed, and perhaps wisely, in looking at the progress of this recovery. But one also needs to interpret why the aggregates are behaving the way they are and whether it is demand shifts or changes in the structure of intermediation and so on that may be neutral in terms of their implications for the cost and availability of credit to support it. President Syron. Mike, I have two questions, which are somewhat technical in.nature, dealing with historical [precedent] in data series.  One is that just in talking to people and getting anecdotal information on the housing market, [that information] is consistent unfortunately with the pattern of data that was announced this morning. What I was wondering is whether there is any evidence of increased sensitivity to mortgage rate changes in housing and how that fits in.  I remember in one of your earlier nonfinancial reports that you talked about almost a change in the relationship between prices and purchases. That is, as prices stopped declining in some markets, there was a hypothesis at least that people were more willing to buy because they were less concerned about the [potential] loss, which was a different sign on price than we thought. 5/19/92 I have a second question, but I wanted to get to that one first to ask how this fits in with our historical experience and whether there has been a change in habits. Well, as a general matter, we would perceive the interest sensitivity of the housing sector as being reduced from what it once was, in part because of reduced market segmentation--the elimination of the non-price rationing effects that occurred a couple of decades ago when rates moved above Reg Q ceilings and we got disintermediation. The introduction of ARMs might work in the same direction, but how important that is isn't clear. There's a question on mortgage rates.  Some people have been able through considerable effort to tease out of econometric equations some suggestion that people will wait until the rates have come down and they don't think rates are going to go down any further before they will move. But that is a very short-run phenomenon and it doesn't seem to be a very important result over significant spans of time. On the price side, it depends on which model you think is most relevant.  There's an affordability model, which clearly does have some importance. That looks at mortgage rates and prices and at that combination relative to income; and that says that we have had a considerable improvement in affordability over the past couple of years.  On the other side, if you look at an investment model, a user- cost model, it says that it's cheaper to own a home when you're getting capital gains.  So expected price movements would be important in that model.  Basically we've taken a middle-ground view saying affordability is better and the fear that people will be losing their shirts in owning a home is probably abating because house prices generally have firmed some over the past year.  It's a hard call to make as to which of these things is most important.  I think what we've seen recently, as I was suggesting, is that people are very sensitive to a number of aspects of this.  They jumped when they saw those mortgage rates get down to low levels and when there was the first-time home buyer credit [proposal].  They seemed to have pulled back very sharply when rates backed up and the credit [proposal] evaporated.  An environment in which people are still rather uncertain about their employment and income prospects is a fragile situation. And, going back to President Parry's comment, if we can begin to get, without generating strength solely out of the housing sector, some reasonable growth going here and some confidence in employment prospects, then people may move in response to this vastly improved affordability, and we could get a significantly stronger housing expansion than we have forecast. We're certainly operating at low levels even given the prevailing demographic trends. For what it's worth, I think your analysis is probably correct and that we don't necessarily get symmetric behavior. But after we have a period of declining prices, the relative weight on the investment side becomes somewhat more important. The second question I'm trying to figure out is whether to take much encouragement in the household data. I've always been inclined to look more at the payroll data but I'm just wondering whether we do have an historical precedent to some extent or if there has been a shift there because of all of the restructuring that's going on.   Again, one hears these anecdotal stories of many new smaller firms starting, etc.   I just wanted to ask you if you could 5/19/92 explore that a bit more because we are seeing quite a diversion in patterns [between the two series].  I'm grasping for encouragement here if you can provide it. Well, it's not bad news. The question is how much good news there is in these numbers. We've looked at the history and a lot of other analysts have too.   Some have declared that there is some lead, particularly in the early phases of an upturn, in the household employment series relative to the payroll series. Others have said that's just not a very robust relationship. We find hints, but [the relationship] doesn't seem to be highly reliable. The fact is that in the payroll series the Bureau of Labor statistics make an allowance for new business formations as well as the closing down of businesses. And it is a little murky how they do this.    It is conceivable that they're underestimating the rate of new business formations if the economy is picking up and that that is biasing the change downward. But as I suggested, looking at corollary evidence entirely separate from these things--such as initial claims and the responses in the Conference Board surveys about job availability--all these other things don't suggest that employment is growing at 300,000 plus a month.   [Actual growth] may be somewhere in between but I'm more inclined to think it may be closer to the payroll trend at this point than to the household trend. Governor Angell. Mike, looking back at the chart on page III-3 on M2 velocity:  Last fall some around here were quite concerned that M2 growth was quite a good indicator of where [the economy was] and yet these first-quarter numbers I presume [raise] nominal [GNP growth] for the first quarter up to somewhere between 6 and 7 percent. That makes V-2, with a one-quarter lag, shoot up to 4 percent.  Doesn't that really cast a lot of doubt on all that concern about slow M2 growth? Well, as you know, I've not been an enthusiast of that view and have worried that that was more a coincidence. Typically, we have thought of there being a lag between changes in money growth and changes in GDP.  So, the close timing last year I think was not necessarily in line with what we normally consider the relationship to be. Whether a one-quarter lag in velocity gets at this or not is another question. I think we're looking at a period of slow growth of money that stretches back a few years now. And in a sense we haven't gotten some of the payoff [in] disinflation that some might have anticipated.  If [the economy is] growing at the rate it appears to be, that doesn't quite seem to fit.  But I don't want to state the case excessively strongly either. There may have been a message--and it may show up in the second quarter or the third quarter--from that weakening money stock growth last year. Governor Angell, I had some work done, drawing it with the two-quarter lag that people like to use and assuming that the Greenbook is close to right for GDP.  That also shows some pretty sizable increases in velocity in the first half of the year, unlike last year when velocity was a bit flatter.  So, after a while, as I'm about to say in my briefing, I think there is some reason to believe that the weakness in M2 we see this year is not sending us the same kind of signal, whether it's coincidence or not, that it seemed to be sending last year. But there is a question of confidence here.    The  weakness is extreme and even if the signal-to-noise ratio is very, very low-- I calculated the two-quarter lag also and had the same conclusions.  Thank you. There's another way to come at this, which yields much the same results, in the sense that we've got this long-term trend, the P*, tracking the general price level.   The existing pattern of P* at this stage is at virtually zero if not a negative price level.   If one is going to presume on the basis of the data that we are seeing a resistance to coming down under the 3 percent level or even that it is somewhat off the zero base, then the question essentially is whether we are incorrectly measuring [M2] in the same context.   Namely, if M2 is artificially deflated and [that] created this particular zero [or slight] decline, we have the wrong M2; we have the wrong proxy for money.   If we had the right proxy for money, it would be growing much faster than the numbers we are looking at; it would be much closer to the opportunity cost even in the context that Jerry Jordan is raising the issue.   It would also mean that P* is back on track with exactly where the equation numbers are. So, it seems as though the financial system in a general way is more in line with the real economic system, with the outlier essentially being M2.   If we alter M2 everything else falls into place. It's a disturbing consideration, but it sort of leads to the conclusion that all of our theoretical judgments with respect to the effect of the RTC on M2 have not been exactly correct and that there is a significant element of technical erosion in the data as a consequence of the liquidation of the small CDs and the thrifts.   There has been a fairly significant reduction in the thrift area without a spillover--as we all would have expected with the eliminations of the thrifts--from the thrifts into the commercial banks and other depository institutions. Governor LaWare. Mike, I'm puzzled by the corporate profits projection in the Greenbook.  It looks like fairly steady improvement during 1992 and then it goes rather blah in 1993 with a fair amount of swing back and forth from one quarter to another.  What is the rationale behind that projection? Well, without being too precise in this, we've seen some evidence in the first quarter of a very big jump in profits. A sizable move at this point wouldn't be surprising in terms of the historical relations, which suggest an acceleration in output growth that produces an acceleration in profits.  As things level out, as productivity increases begin to move back toward trend, we get a little additional pressure on the profit margins even though the rate of compensation increases is diminishing. And thus we get this leveling out of the profit share and in the pattern we see for total corporate profits.  It may be that profits should be trending up a bit more. That certainly would be more consistent with the view that I think prevails among private analysts, which has consumer price inflation stabilizing or increasing in 1993.  Those people tend to see continuing upward movement in corporate profits. The stock market would seem to indicate that that's the view on the whole.  I think it's very difficult to read what the stock market is building in here. But looking at this year's profit forecasts, recognizing that the PE ratios are distorted by extraordinary factors in 1991 that may be unwinding in 1993, we can see a movement of PEs at current stock price levels back into the high teens, still at a high level historically. But later on this year things will not look as out of line as they do now. And if interest rates are stable or coming down, this all hangs together fairly plausibly.  It's on the high side of history but plausible.  I sense the market probably is taking a view that with expansion come firmer prices and that profits will be a bit better in 1993 than we forecast. Thank you. Mike, just to follow up on your comment on inventories:  You say that in the revised first-quarter numbers inventories are playing a more important role but that should not have an adverse effect going forward. That is what I think I heard you saying. Can you go through that again as to why we would not have some repercussions from that? Well, the repercussion is that had we ended up with the level of sales we are running at with lower inventories as per the initial estimate, that would have been a bullish factor for the economic outlook. As it is, though, we don't see that there is a gross inventory imbalance coming out of the first quarter except for the wholesalers. And in fact in the nondurable wholesale area there are not very many signs of inventory/sales ratios being high.  Our expectation is, though, that inventories are going to be managed very cautiously and that quite possibly wholesale inventories will run off some. Manufacturers show no inclination to see their inventories rise. We expect to see some runoff of inventories for a little while longer but at a lower rate than even the reduced pace that we think the first quarter produced.  So that means that inventory investment makes a small positive contribution in the second quarter in our forecast and a considerably greater contribution in the second half of the year as we see a swing to a mild rate of accumulation as sales trends continue positive. Any further questions? If not, let's move on to the Committee discussion. Let me make a request to those of you who have any insights into the commercial real estate area to put them on the table. Very specifically, I think it would be useful to know if there are any indications of a pickup in commercial real estate transactions, [because] what we have been looking at is a decline in offerings and appraisals. And until we see the bids coming in, we will be getting no indication of any stability. Obviously, as the bids begin to move in, that will engender transactions and it may be a far clearer signal that we're getting closer to the bottom of [the decline in that sector] than any rather dubious price index for commercial real estate.  So, for those of you who have any sense of this, it would be useful for the Committee to get a better view of an area that has been crucial to us and for which our data sources have been less than correct. Who would like to start off?   Jerry. To comment exactly on that point, the commercial bank I was with conducted eight auctions before I left. They were all in the Southwest and on the West Coast. But the process was:  Once we  did the first auction and generated the interest that there is a market out there, each one went better than expected and better than the prior one because it was clear that there was a core market left; [we started] in Texas and then we went over to Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado.  It appeared to us that there were a lot of people who had been waiting for the bottom, figuring that this was going to be the buy of the century in commercial real estate, in particular.  Some of it was raw land but most of it was in structures. As they saw each successive auction going better, with greater interest than the prior one, they became concerned that they had missed the low point and it tended to feed on itself with great success. What is the time frame you're talking about, Jerry? The first one was about 18 months ago, and then about 4 months elapsed before we tried the second one. And from that point it picked up in pace. Jerry, would you like to comment on your general view on the District while you have the floor? Well, just over the last 10 weeks the sense around the Fourth District is that things are definitely improving. The comments from all parts of the District have been of a uniformly upbeat nature.  The negative tones come in on the lack of robustness-- not on the direction but the vigor--and still with expressions of concern about the durability or sustainability of the expansion. There are frequent references by full-time directors and members of our small business advisory and small banker advisory councils to having been disappointed last year when they thought the recovery was under way, and they are concerned now that we could have another false start. Most of the durable goods manufacturers, especially the capital goods firms that have the ability to export, are experiencing very strong order books.  Some are exporting to Canada and some to Europe with some surprise at the strength, especially in Germany, in their capital goods [orders].  A number are expressing pleasure at having recaptured domestic markets, especially those in the auto sector who now are able to start selling to Japanese transplant companies and finding success against foreign competition in that area. President Black. Mr. Chairman, the staff forecast has changed really just a little since the last time.  We thought it was a good forecast then, and it still seems to be a reasonable forecast to us. Certainly, most of the anecdotal and other information that we are getting in the Fifth District and also in the country as a whole is consistent with this relatively moderate rate of recovery that the staff is projecting. On the point regarding commercial real estate transactions, our Vice Chairman is a big real estate operator. He does a large volume of business and also is a solvent real estate developer, which makes him an unusual breed. He has been reporting for about two months now that commercial real estate is beginning to move.  Nothing new is being built, but it is beginning to move; the prices had  dropped to the point that they looked attractive.   He also always adds \\\"and there's plenty of financing out there for it.\\\"   This was not true a while back, but that's the way he has seen it for some two months. And I think that's a pretty [reliable] reading because his firm operates in a lot of cities throughout the country. It's certainly true that both manufacturing activity and retail sales did appear to have decelerated a bit since we had the gains earlier in the year. Nevertheless, most of our contacts believe that the recovery is here to stay this time. That view was universal at our last board meeting, for example.  And for the most part they expect their own businesses and industries to grow at a solid, if something less than spectacular, rate over the months ahead. These contacts cite a wide variety of leading indicators; they all seem to have their favorites, and those range from increasing trucking activity to reduced loan delinquencies to rising telephone hookups, and on and on. Even though I think the staff forecast is reasonable, it's certainly true that reasonable forecasts don't always come true.   So we have to ask, as we always should, where the risk lies. And I think the risk of errors may be on the down side.   I'm bothered by this sharp deceleration in the rate of growth in M2, although I think your explanation comes very close to explaining why it has misbehaved, and I'm very sympathetic to that.   The apparent continued sluggishness in May is obviously a further risk on the down side, and it's a risk I worry about a great deal.   Still, I believe we can be fairly certain that the weakness that we had results from these special factors such as the lower non-withheld personal income tax payments and the movement into other kinds of assets, this substitution for M2-type balances.   My 85 year old mother-in-law, for example, is now out in the longer end of the market and that is something I never thought would take place! And I think we'll be better able to gauge-- She's holding until maturity? Well, if we get the lower interest rates that the staff has projected she might take capital gains on that! Anyway, I think to be better able to read the significance of M2 we have to get a little further past April and the tax date. Now, on the other side, I think it's worth noting that the main differences between the staff forecast and most other forecasts is that the staff expects inflation to decline further this year and then hold steady next year. Many of the other forecasters think inflation is going to bottom out this year and is going to be higher in the next few years.  The staff is also projecting, as I just mentioned, lower long-term interest rates over the period ahead and it seems as if most other forecasters expect interest rates to continue on an uptrend.  I see the Greenbook projection as more desirable, and it is certainly plausible. But I believe the chances of achieving this are going to depend pretty highly on whether or not we make the right policy calls in the critical months ahead.   In particular, I think we have to convince the markets and the public that we are still determined to reduce inflation further even as we try to foster this budding recovery we apparently have under way.   The credibility of our long-term strategy is at a very crucial point right now and it's really on the line.  So, I think we need to do all we can to reinforce  this commitment that I think all of us in this room share to working inflation down over the longer run. President Parry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy is experiencing varied signals, with weakness in California offset by modest growth in other District states.   In California, there is some improvement in the north, with continued problems in the southern part of the state.   I guess that latter comment is something of an understatement. The five-county Los Angeles area accounts for 50 percent of state employment and it also accounts for 80 percent of the 550,000 jobs in the state that were lost between May 1990 and March 1992.   So, it's clear that not only is there weakness in the state but it is highly concentrated in the southern part of the state. The riots in Los Angeles are estimated to have cost $1 billion in total property damage and to have resulted in additional job losses of around 25,000.   Now, I have seen estimates as high as 40,000, and that may be referring to a peak that endured for just the number of days immediately following the riots.   But the number that we're going with is 25,000; and expectations are that in a number of weeks that could fall below 10,000 as some buildings are repaired and some stores are restocked, because some stores were just looted and not seriously damaged.  There is also obviously further concern about the effects of the riots on tourism and firm location decisions. And while I'm still talking about Los Angeles, I don't think I can give you any of those glimmers of hope with regard to commercial real estate.   Last year 9 million square feet of office space was added in the Los Angeles area. It caused vacancy rates to shoot up quite a bit; it depressed lease rates and property values; and projects under way indicate that the problem is going to get somewhat worse before it gets better.   So, I have not been able to pick up any improvements, at least in the Los Angeles area.   I would agree with what Jerry Jordan says in terms of some other areas in the District.   We even picked up a few optimistic comments coming from some people in the state of Washington where there also was a fairly serious condition of over-building as well. For the state [of California] as a whole, indicators of economic activity are mixed.  Existing home sales reports indicate a modest rebound; payroll employment rose in April; and it appears as though agricultural conditions are improving. However, manufacturing employment continues to contract. And while construction employment has risen for two consecutive months, nonresidential construction awards and residential permits are below their year-earlier levels. There is a very big issue that you may begin to read a bit more about in the month ahead.   Reflecting recent economic weakness, the state faces a severe shortfall of $10 to $12 billion through the end of the next fiscal year. Not surprisingly, revenues have fallen substantially below projections. The law in California requires that they enter the new fiscal year with tax and spending plans to produce a balanced budget.   And this is before July 1st.  There obviously are some things that they can do that are of a rather tricky nature, but in large part they have to find $10 to $12 billion of reduced spending or higher taxes.   And that's not exactly the Keynesian approach to dealing with California's problems.  Outside of California, District states have performed relatively well over the recession, and they continue to show modest growth. Construction activity is rising in several District states as are home sales.  Cutbacks continue to be reported, unfortunately, in aerospace, with job losses of 6,500 projected for Boeing this year.   I should point out that Boeing employs over 100,000 in the Seattle area. In addition, Boeing continues to have a large backlog of orders and actually has a very strong long-run forecast with growing demand from the Pacific and Asian region. Contacts that we have in nondefense manufacturing report a modest rebound, with lumber and wood products manufacturing currently bottoming out, and that was a considerable source of weakness in the past year. If I may turn briefly to the national scene, incoming data since our last meeting seem to add to confidence that a moderate recovery is under way. Indeed, as I [noted] in my discussion with Mike, it's not difficult to come up with an outlook that is a bit stronger than is indicated in the Greenbook. For example, our analysis points to somewhat greater strength in inventory investment, residential construction, and net exports.  And we end up with a growth rate over the next year and a half of a little over 3 percent compared to the Greenbook expectation of 2-3/4 percent.  I agree with the Greenbook that inflation is on a very slow downward trend, but I fear that such slow progress will make others question the resolve of the Fed to deal with inflation longer term. It seems to me that we might be at a point soon where we'll have to be more forthcoming about our inflation objectives.  And probably we can't do that until 1993. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. President Forrestal. Mr. Chairman, in the Sixth District, conditions clearly have continued to improve. The business people I have spoken to over the last several weeks are much more upbeat than they were and they have more confidence that the recovery is going to be sustainable.  I hear much less talk about a stalling of the economy or a double or triple dip, whatever you want to call it.  There also, I think, is a recognition among business people recently that the recovery is going to be modest. They are no longer looking for that historical type of recovery that we've had. We've had gains in a number of areas in the District--retail sales among them, especially in apparel.    And that's in spite of the fact that we had a late Easter and some bad weather. Auto sales have also been relatively good, as have other durables, particularly those related to housing. Home sales have been fairly decent also and that has reduced [housing] inventories and led to greater growth in housing permits.    Capital spending is projected to be fairly modest, but manufacturers are reporting that orders and shipments are turning up. A couple of other areas that are important to us are tourism and [convention] business, and we see gains in both of those areas. On the commercial construction question that you asked, anecdotally I've been hearing from people that commercial construction perhaps is at the low point.  I can say that commercial space is much less of a drag than it has been. We've had some absorption of space and that is beginning to stabilize lease prices. And that's pretty much [the case] around the District's major cities.  On the price  side, prices for finished goods are holding relatively steady, and in other industries we see stable input prices and no pressure on wages. The two geographical areas that are dragging a little are Florida and Louisiana.  Florida is suffering from reductions in defense spending particularly, as well as the lower interest rates that are affecting the high number of retirees.  I guess there are a lot of mothers-in- law in Florida! Tell them to go long! Louisiana continues to suffer as a result of the energy situation. So, with respect to the District, Mr. Chairman, things are looking relatively good and more sustainable, as I said, than they had been. With respect to the national picture, the Greenbook forecast is quite a reasonable one and, in fact, I would be very happy if we could achieve it, especially on the inflation side. Our forecast is about the same as the Greenbook in terms of GDP but we see somewhat lower unemployment and higher inflation.   I think the difference is basically that productivity gains [are lower] and labor costs are higher in our forecast than in the Greenbook. I do think the expansion is likely to endure.  The efforts we see on the part of people to get their balance sheets in order lay the foundation for a more sustainable expansion but, of course, we haven't seen the full effects of that, and I guess that leads to some questions about the risks to the forecast.  I was prepared to mention that but Mike did a very good job of detailing those risks in the forecast, so I won't go over that again. I would say with respect to the slow growth of M2 that a lot of this, if not all of it, we hear is principally the run-off of small time deposits.   Banks are not bidding very aggressively for funds in this current environment and that suggests the process of financial disintermediation is still constraining. Putting all of this together, it seems to me that the risks in the forecast are more evenly balanced than they were. They are more symmetrical, and that suggests to me that we don't need a change in policy at the moment.    I continue to be concerned about the outlook for inflation. Maybe participants in the market are wrong, but it seems to me that the yield curve is telling us something about future prices that we need to take into account. The price numbers themselves are somewhat disappointing and we don't know at this point whether we are looking at a temporary blip or whether we are on a trajectory toward a higher level of prices.   So, I think as we approach the policy discussion we should move very, very cautiously.   Thank you. With regard to the District, the modest but steady progress that has been in place for quite some time continues, and I won't go into details except that there are a few concerns around. One is in agriculture where, of course, this time of year moisture is always the major uncertainty, and that is the issue in some parts of the District.  Beyond that, there is some concern in the timber industry where environmental issues are limiting activity, and we've seen some marginal mining operations go out of business. But otherwise the District economy is in pretty good shape, I think. Attitudes are also in pretty good shape.  With regard to the national economy, my views do not differ from most that have been expressed so far. As Mike Prell indicated, if anything, we've done at least as well or better really than we thought we would over the last couple of quarters.  That [improvement] does seem in my judgment to be continuing; I'm referring to the real side, and I don't see any reason at this juncture for renewed or additional concern in terms of real activity. The disappointment, to the extent there has been some, has been on the inflation side, at least as measured by consumer prices or the employment cost index. In talking to business people in the District, for the most part they continue to describe a very competitive environment and they don't give any impression that it's easy to raise prices or pass along cost increases or whatever. But it's a little hard to know in light of all the data whether they simply mean by all this that they can live with 3 or 4 percent inflation and thus that's what they mean by a very competitive environment.  It's just hard to know what they have in mind as they describe that situation. With regard to commercial real estate, the situation is quite mixed as best I can judge it.  I have heard of some renewed activity in the construction of warehouse and manufacturing space; it's not a lot, but there do seem to be some signs of life there. With regard to office space, one of our directors, with whom you're familiar, has been \\\"bottom fishing\\\" in terms of buying office space in various parts of the country for a couple of years now. He also has bought some raw land in some locations.  I think he feels quite positive and comfortable about this. On the other hand, I do come across investors and developers who tell me it's still difficult to find financing. They're not talking about financing just for new projects but to refinance or to purchase existing buildings; although when I express a counter view and basically describe what one of our directors has done, a number of people will admit that they've been doing that too. It leads me to believe that perhaps there is a little more activity around than we might appreciate, but perhaps it's a little subterranean. Olympia and York has not been a topic of conversation in the Ninth District, but we have our own interesting situation:   The so-called Mall of America, a mega mall, is nearing completion. The first part of it is supposed to open in August and now that it's too late there is growing concern about how successful it is going to be. So, we'll just await developments. President Keehn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In terms of the national economy, our forecast for growth this year is very consistent with the staff forecast. We get there in slightly different ways. Our consumption numbers are a bit lower.  I think the differences in durables probably relate to the fact that our housing numbers are a little lower than those in the staff forecast but, offsetting that, our export numbers are a bit stronger. There is a difference, though, in the outlook for inflation. Our numbers are more constructive than the staff forecast. We expect in terms of the CPI that we would be getting down to the 3 percent area by the end of this year and then perhaps see continued improvement next year. With regard to the District, there seems to be slow but steady improvement in the major segments of our economy.  But I must say the magnitude of the improvement between this meeting and the last  meeting is not quite as great as was the case at the time of the last meeting.  In that prior period there had been pretty good improvement. In fact, in some cases there are signs of moderation appearing. As an example of this, our housing activity is down a bit but from very high levels.  Seasonal factors had a big effect on January and February housing activity. Also, that was a period in which mortgage rates had come down quite substantially and that gave housing in the Midwest a push; but we're now seeing some softness in housing.  Retail activity also has slowed a bit; it is still positive compared to last year but the momentum has slowed, again from a very rapid pace in both January and February. On the other hand, the manufacturing sector continues to show slow but steady improvement.   Second-quarter production in the auto industry is continuing to run well ahead of last year, but of course the second quarter last year was comparatively weak.   Third-quarter schedules have been set a little higher than the third quarter of last year, but the magnitude is not as great as the pace of the second quarter.   Current dealer attitudes are good, I'm told. Their order rate from manufacturers is very much in line with the production schedules.   But I will say the dealer order rate is a bit ahead of the retail sales level.   Still, the inventories out there don't seem to be out of line, particularly for this time of the year.   I must say that in this overall category I have heard from just everybody that the demand for light trucks is very, very strong. The industry sales forecasts are a little stronger than ours.   They are expecting a very good third quarter and an even better fourth quarter.   So, there is more to come on that. The heavy truck business continues to be better than last year. The current order rate is running about 10 percent ahead of last year, but of course that's an increase from a very low level.   And heavy truck manufacturers are operating at about 70 percent of capacity. They are forecasting an improved sales level this year of only about 119,000 units and that's versus a good year of, say, 165,000 to 175,000 units. The steel business also is doing a little better; orders, particularly for sheet, are coming in at good levels.   That I think is reflective of the auto production schedules and also a bit of strength on the appliance side.   The steel industry is operating at about 83 percent of capacity. They're going to ship 40 million tons in the first half and are forecasting 42 million tons for the second half, so it ought to be a good year in terms of the [tonnage] being shipped. But the pricing is just terrible.    I find this somewhat of a contradiction:   They're shipping a lot of metal but they're just not making any money. With regard to the real estate question that you asked about, the firm I talked with feels that we may be getting to the point of stability but we still aren't there yet.   They are seeing some increased interest on the part of funds to buy real estate.   There's a greater level of interest but not a significant volume [of sales] is taking place.   They think we're going to have a continuation of price declines this year, perhaps as much as 10 percent for the year as a whole.  That's lower than in previous years, which again is indicative that we're getting to a point of stability.   The vacancy rates in Chicago are going to go up.   We have two or three big projects that are still finishing up, so our already fairly high vacancy rates are going to go up.   This firm does not anticipate a return to normal vacancy levels until 1995 or 1996.  In the agricultural sector, we've had a very unusual planting season.  It has been cold and wet in most of our area. But in one week, the week of May 10th, some 50 percent of the corn acreage was planted, which was pretty phenomenal.  However, given the carryover stocks, which were fairly low, and the significant uncertainty with regard to weather, our expectation is that it's going to be a year in which prices are going to be very, very weather-related, but at least we're off to a pretty good start.  I might say that the ag equipment business is sour.  Contrary to earlier expectations, retail sales of major agricultural implements have slowed significantly. It's down about 13 percent currently from last year.  As a consequence the production schedules, which had been set at a pretty conservative level, now are being reduced. With regard to inflation, I do think that the outlook is increasingly constructive. Price increases are just not sticking.    In the manufacturing sector, I continue to be impressed by the major manufacturers who are continuing to get decreases in their prices for purchased products or, if there are increases, they are pretty modest. The same also is true in the retail sector.   People who supply the major retail stores know that they just can't get price increases through. The consumers in turn are very tough.    So, I must say general attitudes in the District are that rising prices are just not a major danger. Labor contracts continue to be negotiated under favorable terms. Three-year contracts are the norm. The occasional six-year contract in the paper industry and the wage increases under these contracts are easily managed through productivity improvements. After months of bitterness that I have commented on from time-to-time here, the Caterpillar strike just went \\\"poof.\\\"   When the company threatened and then began to bring in replacement workers, the union attitude just collapsed. They have not, of course, settled the contract yet, but they're back at work. This won't necessarily set a pattern for the UAW negotiations with the auto companies this fall, but certainly it's going to have an effect on the tone as they go into those discussions. Net, while I think the economy is continuing to show signs of slow but steady improvement, without more strength in some of the major segments the question [of sustainability] has to be a significant one. Therefore, as we see it, the risks in terms of growth continue to be on the down side. And with the improved outlook with regard to inflation, it seems to us that our policy response should be geared to dealing with signs of deterioration in growth should they begin to emerge. Thank you. President Boehne. I'd say the District is mixed. Manufacturing has been up for several months running but there is some slowing in the pace of advance.  In retailing, there just isn't much of a trend either up or down; it seems to be fairly stuck. Residential [construction] is growing but not robustly. As to your commercial real estate question, I have the sense that the District is either at or approaching the bottom of the hole but that there is not much sign of a pickup.  The general [view] is that this is a three-to-five year problem to work our way out of before we get vacancy rates at the point that they will stimulate much  construction. The bankers, I think, feel that the worst surprises are on the table; but the most optimistic feeling is that we may be at about the bottom. The bankers see some evidence of a pickup in loan demand, although not much in the hard numbers; it's more at the inquiry stage. Attitudes, in contrast to this mixed view of the real sector, are more upbeat than the hard numbers would support underneath. There just is a sense that things are going to move, and that's an improvement over a couple of months ago.  But I suspect that this sentiment is not firmly based and that one or two months of poor sales or shrinking orders would change the attitudes. Nonetheless, I think the attitudes are better. For the national economy, I think we do have a moderate recovery; if anything, it's faster than expected. And it's hard not to feel better about the sustainability issue and feel that we have a sustainable recovery. The money supply issue strikes me as one of those things we can argue about day-in and day-out. We have some good reasons not to worry about it, but it is a shadow that hangs over us. I think the only way to settle it is not to worry about it as long as it's an outlier and the economy picks up.  But if we start to see some weakening in the real sector, then it's going to mean something.  It's almost an agnostic approach in terms of how we should deal with it. On the inflation side, my sense is, much as Si just expressed, that it's awfully hard to see upward pressures in prices. The other side of that is that, particularly in large cities, the unemployment problem looks as if it's just stuck. There is an attitude both from the business side as well as those people seeking jobs that there just isn't going to be much improvement.  How all that will play its way out through the warm summer months in these cities is something that one has to be uneasy about. President McTeer. Relatively speaking, the Eleventh District economy remains one of the stronger District economies, at least in terms of employment.   From the bottom of the recession in April of 1991, employment has grown about 1-1/2 percent in our District. Within the District the weakest, and the declining, sector is energy and the main source of strength is exports, especially exports to Mexico, which account for a third of Texas exports to foreign countries.   Between 1990 and 1991, Texas exports to Mexico were up 16-1/2 percent; and exports to Canada, which is our second largest internationaltrading partner, were up almost 8 percent.    The number of businesses requesting information on assistance with exporting from the international marketing division of the Texas Department of Commerce was as great through April as they had expected for the entire year.   So, there's a lot of activity gearing up for the prospective North American Free Trade Agreement, which is very important to our part of the country. And given the present economic environment and political climate, freer trade--even though we would all agree that it's desirable--is becoming a harder sell politically. That's not so much true in our area because our business people expect to benefit disproportionately from NAFTA, but I hope that all of you throughout the country will give it a plug in your speeches and in your publications and your economic education efforts.   I think it's  very important to the near-term and long-term health of the economy. Prospects are pretty good for continued growth in our District based on the confidence that we hear increasingly expressed in the business community and based on our leading indicator indexes. President Hoenig. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our District economy is growing, but it's still very slow and somewhat mixed. As others have mentioned here, the agriculture area is subject to some uncertainty due to the dry weather. Also, in our area cattle is a very important industry and, although prices are up, there's a lot of uncertainty there. With this environment of uncertainty there has been some very reduced activity in the agricultural sector; in fact our banks' loan-to-deposit ratios in that sector are at their lowest levels in some time, at just over 50 percent. Manufacturing is mixed to flat, I would say. In the aircraft industry there has been some slowing in shipments recently. And in our auto industry, there has been activity but no real expansion in activity, with some modest gains overall in employment. Our energy industry is suffering very significantly. The level of drilling activity in both oil and gas is at post-World War II lows and [the outlook is] not at all good. Everyone one talks with is blaming it on some of the regulatory restrictions as much as on some of the economics, so that is a very sore point in our area. As to the construction side, construction activity in the residential sector has been very high but our anecdotal information now suggests it is backing off from those highs just as you hear is happening elsewhere. On the commercial real estate side, there is some increased absorption but still enough vacancies out there that we're not seeing any significant pickup in prices.  An important factor we've heard in very recent conversations is that in some of our areas the lease rates remain extremely low. And until those pick up we don't really expect that the price levels are going to pick up at all.  That includes Denver, where there has been some activity; still, lease rates are very favorable, and though we have had some sales we're not seeing a real pickup in the prices or bidding to any large extent. On the national economy, our projections are very similar to those of the Greenbook. There are some differences. We are looking at a little weaker consumer spending and residential investment, and a little stronger government spending and stronger still business fixed investment. On the inflation front, we're very much in line with the staff forecast; we may be a little more optimistic on inflation but not enough to make a real difference overall at this time.  Thank you. President Melzer. I'd like to make two general comments; the first relates to M2 and how to interpret that.  One comment that I don't think has been made in the comments we've heard today is that some work we've done would indicate in our view that the relationship of M2 to nominal GDP is stationary only over very long periods of time.  I think we're talking five or more years.  It follows from that that the ability to predict velocity shifts in the short run is not at all good. Therefore, the idea that--and I'm not suggesting anybody has advocated this--M2 can be used as a short-term targeting tool for  monetary policy, as far as I'm concerned, just doesn't fly.  To some extent, I think the emphasis that we have placed on that target has perhaps in a public relations sense painted us into a corner somewhat, and there are probably ways to deal with that by citing some other factors.  But the fact is, when push comes to shove in the short run, I would have a hard time justifying a policy action aimed at trying to get M2 into the target range or to some point in the target range for these very reasons I've cited. Obviously, it's better to be in the target range, but if we have questions about whether M2 is [outside the range because of] technical or fundamental factors--and we're pretty confident there are some important technical factors--I would be inclined to explain those and take the heat for missing it.  That's the first point I wanted to make. The other point, which relates generally to the economy, is that we're a year into the recovery now and my sense is, both in terms of the statistics that we see and what I hear anecdotally, that the pace is picking up. Obviously, the recovery is not in line with other post World War II recoveries, but I think it's well in place and picking up.  And I'd say that in general other forecasters are probably looking for the best inflation performance in 1992 with some pickup in '93.  Now, we all know what the Board staff's forecast is; but even there Mike has seen fit, based on some recent information, to ratchet the forecast up.  And I think we've seen from time-to-time, not at the present moment, in the bond market and perhaps to some extent in the foreign exchange markets some questions about the Fed's resolve with respect to long-run price stability and so forth versus short-run fine-tuning of the real economy.  The point I would make with respect to that is that I don't think one can get terribly alarmed by anything we've seen in those areas as yet, but once it's clear in those indicators that we've lost credibility it's very hard and very expensive to buy it back. So, in my view we want to stay ahead of that. All of this is to suggest that I think the time really has come for us to focus not on when we're going to ease next but on when it is we are going to tighten.  And my final point on credibility is that while words can help, this is one of those times when people are going to watch what we do, not what we say. Just very quickly on our District, the picture is the same as I presented last month.   We are continuing to have moderate growth. On the employment side, [growth] is coming primarily in the services area. Manufacturing is still sluggish. In particular, strength on the nonmanufacturing side is coming in construction; we have residential and nonresidential contracts up 20 to 30 percent from the prior three-month period. My sense is that in the nonresidential sector it's primarily in the industrial area.   I don't have any sense of [much] going on with transactions in office buildings and so forth at this time.  Finally, just the tone of the comments I pick up is improving. The anecdotal information seems to confirm this picture we've been looking at for some time in terms of improving economic activity in our District. Governor LaWare. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I must say that over the last six weeks or so I have become more of a cautious optimist about what is going on in the economy.  It seems to me that these most recent figures on consumer attitudes forebode a much brighter outcome.  Consumers have been gradually reducing their debt load, which I think has helped to improve their feeling of confidence as reflected in their attitudes toward housing, auto, and appliance acquisitions.   At the same time, long rates most recently have shown some slight improvement, and we have some reason to believe that that may now continue.  The banking system I believe is substantially recovering from the problems that have plagued it the last four or five years. Operating margins, net interest margins have improved; earnings have improved.  The restructuring of many of these institutions toward greater efficiency is beginning to take hold.  Balance sheet values are certainly much sounder and much closer to reality today than they have been, although in some isolated instances there is still a ways to go.  Clearly, they have better access to the capital markets so that the capital shortages that still exist certainly can be dealt with much more easily now than they could have been up until this time.  I believe that these bankers are still cautious lenders.   I think the burns haven't completely healed and the memories about recent events will be long.  But I believe that they are now able, and to some extent willing, to respond to legitimate demands.  So, I think the banks will be able to finance whatever level of recovery is coming along. Corporate conditions, I think, have improved significantly. Again, restructuring has had a very salubrious effect on corporate balance sheets.  Corporations have eliminated in the process not just people, but some poor businesses. The divestiture or even shutting down of businesses that have been otherwise a drag bodes well for future profitability. Also, the reduction in debt service has been appropriate. They have done this through much more favorable debt financing and by replacing debt with equity.  So, I think the general tone there is better and that's why I'm a bit skeptical about the 1993 projection for corporate profits.  I think there may be some fundamental improvement there that can be very helpful. Having said all that, I think the progress on inflation is disappointing in view of the length of time that we have had a fairly restraining hand with regard to policy. And it's particularly disappointing and puzzling that the figures are better when you leave food and energy in right now than when you take them out. They've always been seen as the wild cards. It seems to me that the Greenbook forecast is a reasonable one.  My own would be somewhat more optimistic but only marginally. But I don't think we should be discouraged by a modest growth rate in the GDP.  I think it is fully consistent with a continued move toward price stability, which should be our objective. We must be sure to stop pouring drinks while everyone is still sober, and probably the next policy move will have to be toward restraint rather than ease. President Syron. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To start with the District, I'd say the New England economy remains lethargic.    It's no longer in a pronounced decline but it really has little  momentum going in the opposite direction.   It's interesting actually to hear Bob McTeer talk about things being more encouraging in Dallas.   We've said that things are more encouraging in New England because on a moving  average basis the decline in employment last month was only 2 percent at an annual rate. But we do think things are close to the bottom. As far as different sectors go, after a fairly good opening of the year, the retailers now seem--I've talked to some of them myself--a fair bit more concerned. In housing, we don't know if this has to do with weather or what the story is, but there does seem to be--\\\"softness\\\" is too strong a word--an attenuation in the growth that we've seen in housing.  It had done quite well; now, it's slowing off again, which is why I asked the question about interest rate sensitivity. And, of course, the expected depreciation is a very big issue in New England. As far as your question on real estate goes, it's a very interesting pattern here.  It depends a great deal on the sectors that one looks at.  In the pure office space sector, absorption now is about flat; we don't have negative absorption any more. I hope none of you has too much money in TIAA-CREF because you're going to take some loss in the Boston market.  We have an interesting phenomenon going on with the zero absorption; people are trading up at the same price to higher quality space and there just isn't going to be a market for some of the B+ quality space to [say nothing about the] C space.  The retail market is really quite interesting in that it shows that real estate is very local.  We have a couple of new small shopping centers being built with new retailers coming in at the same time that we have great excess capacity in retail space elsewhere. To come back to something that Jerry Jordan talked about, the one area where there has been some success in auction type sales has been in the condo market. It hasn't held true in the commercial or the retail or office building sectors, but in the condo market finding a price floor has produced the same sort of pattern that Jerry talked about for some of the markets. We hear less about the credit crunch than we did a year ago, although I think it's still somewhat of a residual drag. There are some tentative signs of a pickup in lending. Some of these companies that John LaWare talked about are in a better competitive position. Some of our institutions have raised capital and there's nothing like a little competition. We're hearing now about beating the drums of who will be the next aggressive lender. As far as the manufacturing sector in the region goes, that's mixed.  Well, that's true obviously of anything that's tied to defense, and we have a lot that's tied not only to defense but to commercial aerospace, which is also somewhat weak. Until recently, autos and housing-related manufacturers had been doing relatively well.  An encouraging sign we just had is this:  Digital puts on a show every couple of years where they bring people in from all over the country. And actually they sold more equipment on the floor there than they expected by a fair amount, though other manufacturers we talked to are concerned about seeing their backlogs decline. For the U.S. economy overall, I have little reason, as usual, to disagree with the Greenbook.  I can quibble on the unemployment rate, which we think might be a little higher in the out period than the staff has it, but the difference is minimal.  Also, I reflect everyone else's concerns about disappointment on inflation. Looking ahead, while I don't have any disagreement with any individual  forecast--and this doesn't hold true just for the Greenbook--in most forecasts there has been a serial correlation going out two to three quarters, and we've all been overly optimistic.  Again, it's not a criticism of any individual forecast but it makes me wonder why that has been the case and whether it's more inertia and whether there has been more of a shock to the economic system in some confidence sense [than was anticipated].  And it makes me worry, particularly since we're counting a bit [on] even the relatively anemic growth we see in this quarter, [about] what is going to happen to PCE in the durables sector and autos and in final sales generally. That leads me to the view, even if I agree with this [forecast] that the probabilities are fairly evenly balanced on the outlook, that I'm not sure the risks are relatively evenly balanced.  The reason is that if we were to get another negative surprise regarding the pickup, I'd be quite concerned about the impact that could have on confidence and for building in this inertia in terms of trying to get things moving. Another part of that, though, is that I don't think there's very much we can do about it.  Just looking at what is happening in several asset markets, there is a potential for disappointment, an incongruity between the rate of growth we expect in the economy and some asset [market behavior], particularly in my own mind the securities markets. Now, I'm not saying it's our role to ratify it, but I think we have to take into consideration that that's a potential disappointment that is going to come along and is going to have a negative pull on the economy. I agree very much with Tom Melzer's comments on the Ms.   I've always been pretty agnostic about that. But I think we're in this difficult position in that we've said that we're watching the Ms, and I worry about a situation in which we might have a combination of the economy coming in soft and the aggregates being out of their ranges. I'm worried about that even in a world in which we do want to get to lower inflation. I think we all agree on [the desirability of] getting to price stability, but the problem I have is that we could see something snap in the process here that would lead to protectionism, fiscal policy [moves], and other kinds of things that would make it more difficult in an ironic way for us to get to price stability. At some point I think we're going to get some happy surprises in terms of this correlation of the forecasts, and I'm looking forward to that and will be happy to deal with those when the time comes.  Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe that there should be any bias toward a happy surprise more than a continued negative surprise at this point in time. Thank you, Dick. Governor Angell. I've always been very sympathetic to watching the monetary aggregates, and I believe that they really are a very [integral] part of our fundamental program against inflation. But as you know, from time-to-time I have looked carefully at other means to determine whether or not there is a shift in demand for any one of the aggregates. And I've concentrated on commodity prices as probably being the most sensitive in showing whether or not monetary restraint truly is in place or whether [policy is] characterized by monetary ease. At the present time commodity prices, although they have the reputation of being very volatile, seem rather stable to me.  If there's any trend it's probably slightly upward but not as strong as ordinarily would be seen in a recovery phase.  So, on the surface that doesn't seem to show great inflation signals out ahead.  Gold prices probably need to be looked at some, particularly since there are those who view the declining gold prices as [unintelligible] into growth rates.  This thesis holds that M2 growth has been very slow and it shows up by following gold prices.   I think it's important to recognize that gold is always [unintelligible] in regard to its monetary properties and for a long period of time gold prices were lower than market forces would have dictated due to the fact that many governments wanted to sell out their gold stocks. Consequently, gold stayed in the [$340] range a lot longer than it otherwise would have.   Costs of production in many places in the world were way above that, and so there was no technology going into that industry. When gold prices are running up so the optimists believe the price is going to be in the $500 range, then you get a surge of technology into that industry. And it seems to me we're experiencing the impact of that surge. Indeed, the surge has been primarily a U.S. surge.   In the United States, we've had during the 1980s over $8 billion of investments in gold mining, just as an example of what technology can do when the price outlook is favorable. That has resulted in a very quick [advance] for the United States from nowhere in the park of gold producers to the number 2 position.   Indeed, production in the United States is now above 60 percent of that in South Africa and very well could exceed South African production before the decade is over. A new technology involving heat-bleaching means that the cost of production with that new technology runs closer to $250 an ounce rather than to $350 an ounce. When you look at what is happening in Chile and other areas around the world, it looks as if this same technology probably is catching on in other places. One would then expect the price of gold to fall closer to its cost-of- production in the marginally efficient areas.   I give this explanation I suppose partly because I've begun to receive \\\"hate mail\\\" [accusing me] of having been unresponsive to falling gold prices and [saying that I] should have been an advocate of monetary ease based upon that. How did you answer the question? Well, I answered the question by saying that I have never supported $350 an ounce gold; people just think that I do. I thought it was in support of gold $10 below wherever it is now! I see. Well, it's all right to be in that direction.  It seems to me that we ought not let the current information on inflation, disappointing as it is, cause us to move to precipitate action.  It seems to me that sound money is something we accomplish over a long period of time.  But it does suggest to me that the level of restraint that's out there is probably not as great as many have thought it to be and that we do need to be in a posture of maintaining constant restraint over time until we get the producer price index numbers behaving better than they're behaving. There's no reason for us not to get inflation in the goods sector quickly down to zero. And I think if we maintain the kind of posture that's needed, that will occur.  I do think there will be a time lag between [that and] the adjustment of inflation in the services sector to zero. Looking at the real economy, the Greenbook forecast is one with which I would have no strong arguments.  I would expect exports to be somewhat stronger than in the Greenbook and I would expect  productivity gains in 1993 to be more of a continuation of the patterns seen in 1992.  I would consequently expect corporate profits to be in range similar to what John LaWare has outlined. It's a very disappointing period in regard to those inflation numbers.  I think we do not stand ourselves in good stead by representing too strong an interest in movements in the real economy from quarter-to-quarter. Vice Chairman. In terms of the national economy, our forecast is very similar to what Mike talked about earlier today. And as he indicated, and others have also, I also have a feeling that the risks are distinctly more balanced. That seems broadly consistent with the kinds of things one hears on the anecdotal side with this nagging question about sustainability, which is a question that nags at me a little too.  But in talking with business people, especially to the multinationals, most of them are now saying that things are better and a few are saying that they're better with emphasis.   And that, I think, is different.  Several people have cited exports; again, the anecdotal comments from these companies are quite consistent with that in terms of being surprised at how well their export activity is holding up. And as Ted or Mike or somebody said, a lot of it is to Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Japan. On the commercial real estate question, I have reported over several meetings a sense that the decline in prices in the New York area had abated and perhaps even bottomed out.   And I think I mentioned at least once that there were very specific transactions, quasi-auctions, for very large buildings where they had cleared the market. I know of at least a couple of cases [of property] sold by banks where they cleared the market at prices that exceeded the charged down level on the books of the banks--in other words, the provisions which they had taken for [loan losses].   Now, at least in the New York area--and someone may have touched on this when I was out of the room--I think the Olympia & York situation does cast a bit of a cloud over that. Their total real estate in New York is enormous and I think it's a little too early to make a judgment on that. But that could represent a further dent here, certainly in New York. The jury is very, very much out so far as how that is going to play out.   As I said, that introduces a new element of uncertainty. Looking more broadly--a number of people have already touched on this and I don't want to beat a dead horse--let me comment on this inflation outlook issue. If I look at the 1993 forecast that Mike has, 3.2 percent I think in the CPI ex food and energy, I sense that that is a reasonable number.  I think it is going to be darn hard to do better than that, and it's not so hard to see how we can do worse than that.  Again, and John LaWare touched on this, in a broader perspective of what has happened going back to 1988 in terms of the CPI ex food and energy, we've essentially gone out through 1993 in the forecast from a 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate to 3.2 percent.   So, we will have brought about, if you will, a 1.3 percentage point decline in core inflation. And if you look at it in terms of cost, it's five years of cumulatively very modest growth at best; the last two years, 1992 and 1993, are a little better but for the five years as a whole, it's not much. Now, if you look at M2--and I agree with a lot of people in that I think that's not the right thing to look at-- we will have had seven years of distinctly modest M2 growth going out  through 1993.  What I keep coming back to here is that no matter what we look at we also have to look at what is underneath, such as compensation costs, productivity, and unit labor costs, and there's a lot of slippage there. But when you go underneath, even if you look at it simply as arithmetic and not as economics, it's still hard to see--at least I find it hard to see--how we're going to do a heck of a lot better, if at all better, than that very costly process that we've seen over the last five years.  I don't think that should alter our commitment to work toward that goal of price stability, however that's defined.  But the evidence is rather overwhelming that this is a very slow, costly, tough, grinding out process.  I don't see much that's going to change that. Governor Mullins. I guess I have nothing especially useful or new to add.  I generally agree with a lot of what has been expressed.    I think we have a weak recovery. And as I understand the Greenbook, the recovery is projected to be fueled by growth in consumption driven by growth in income.   The only difficulty is identifying where the growth in income will come from.   I guess the answer is sort of everywhere and nowhere. Everything grows a little and the whole juggernaut gradually moves forward and momentum will carry us.   It seems to me that the concern about sustainability is really the fact that we can't point to an engine driving this.   Perhaps we thought it was going to be residential housing; I think there's evidence that the steam is coming out of that.   And there are still concerns about losing steam especially if the first-quarter growth rate turns out to be 4 percent and the second quarter is 2 percent; that might have some impact on confidence.  It is encouraging that consumer buying attitudes, as John LaWare mentioned, in all three of the major categories of the Michigan survey have steadily strengthened. But the overall confidence index is still below where it was in the summer through September, though that's still progress.   When I look at the picture, I don't see much that is robust on the real side or the financial side, but there is relatively broad-based progress in terms of moving forward.   And, with the ample slack in production resources, echoing a little of what Jerry Corrigan was saying, I don't see too much risk on the up side. The economy still has an adjustment to make on defense spending, in state and local governments such as California, and in commercial real estate; we still have some further financial adjustment to go as well. I think Bob Parry is probably right:   The economy could easily be stronger with growth above 3 percent, but the consequences of that sort of upside risk would not bother me much. It is discouraging that after the long period of slow economic growth and many years of slow money growth we haven't made more progress on inflation.   I should point out that I think we've only had significant slack in the economic system for a little over a year and a half now. When I came on the Board the unemployment rate was 5-1/2 percent and capacity utilization was 85 percent or higher. It is also interesting to note that inflationary expectations as measured by the Michigan survey in the near term continue to come down gradually; but it is still true that core CPI is 4 percent, where it has been for eight years.   I think it is probably deeply embedded. On the financial side, short rates in real terms look low now and less low for lending to bank customers because the prime rate is  6-1/2 percent; it still has the margin built into it and consumer rates have that margin as well.  So, I think we still have something of a dichotomy where I see easy conditions on rates in the financial markets and somewhat tighter conditions in the intermediated markets. I think it's fair to say that the yield curve is still very steep, and it's not clear to me that this is driven by inflationary expectations. It's pretty clear that people are betting big money that rates are going to be a lot higher in a year or so. And I think it's not at all unlikely, even if inflation doesn't re-emerge when credit demands re-emerge, that we will be joining the global village of high real rates just as everyone else has high real short-term rates.  We're really the outlier in the world, and it's primarily because we have such weak loan demand. As far as M2 is concerned, I'm certainly not here to praise it; I thought we buried it last summer but someone dug it up again. I'm fully prepared to accept the notion that the traditional relationship between M2 and GDP has been distorted by weakness in the financial system associated with restructuring. Just because the traditional relationship is altered does not mean that a sharp deceleration of M2 conveys no useful information. Obviously, I'm a bit biased by this coincidence last summer. We've only had a handful of months in recorded economic history where M2 has been negative or zero. We had one last July and then August and September were essentially flat.  In the fourth quarter, we did get some deceleration but now in March and April it is negative. Clearly, the traditional relationships don't hold, but dramatic decelerations still make me nervous.  Now, since the RTC has shut down temporarily, M2 should snap back smartly, presumably. And we're over the tax season. I don't know how much comfort to take in Tom Melzer's observation that the relationship holds only over a long period of five years.  I tend to conclude from that that we're going to have five years of stagnation some time in the future. The only other thing I would add to the M2 debate--other than saying that it's a mystery and I'm less concerned with it being low than with the deceleration--is that it's not only M2 that is weak and not only M2 and M3 that are weak but L is weak. It's not just intermediated liabilities that are weak. Domestic nonfinancial nongovernmental debt is, I would suggest, about as weak as it has been in any period we've recorded. Even when you throw in the government, who is usually a dependable borrower, it still looks relatively weak. So, my view is that with projected GDP growth in the second quarter of 2 percent, with 1 percent of that coming from autos and 1/2 percent from inventories, without a dependable engine to keep the momentum going, with this weakness in credit pretty much across the board, and less concern for capacity to overshoot at this stage, I still think the most prudent stance is to remain sensitive to the risks of losing momentum. Governor Kelley. Mr. Chairman, we are now five months into the year. At the very first of the year, there was an extremely strong consensus that [economic activity] was going to start out very slow and then begin to gain a bit of momentum in the second quarter and be much stronger thereafter. A contrariness instinct at that time was to ask the question:  \\\"Where is the surprise going to come from?\\\" because the consensus was too strong. There was some indication that the surprise might be on the up side, and by the time we met in March it  was fairly clear that we were getting an upside surprise.   News over the last six weeks has been that it looks as if the first quarter was even better than [expected].   So, it seems now that the question has shifted just a little to:   \\\"Is what we've seen so far something of a false dawn or are we going to continue to be favorably surprised on the up side?\\\"  There is the usual array of factors and we've certainly been through them this morning. On the concern side are the aggregates and the fact that housing has again slowed a bit.   Several sea anchors are still [restraining growth]:   commercial real estate, the defense slowdown, net exports, and the disappointment we all feel in the year so far with regard to the CPI ex food and energy. As I look at that array it seems to me that people might say in the market that most of that has been there for a while.   And while it's still there it has had its impact. On the other hand, I think one can say that there may be, and hopefully are, a couple of emerging trends on the favorable side that haven't really had a chance to catch on yet.   One may be employment growth.   I've been taught since I've been here that the payroll survey on employment is more reliable than the household survey, and I accept that.   But it may be that early in a recovery here we are getting some leadership from the household survey.   I wouldn't suggest that employment has grown 350,000 a month, but it may be that the household survey is telling us that [employment growth] is somewhat stronger than we thought. If the household survey is telling us good things, they are coming from the places that traditionally have helped a lot and that is small-business entrepreneurial activity and so forth, [and the statistics] may lag a little [before] the payroll survey picks that up.   The other [favorable trend] that may just be beginning to set in is in the area that we've called in short hand \\\"the credit crunch.\\\"   An array of factors is there. As John discussed a while ago, banks clearly are stronger:   Their profitability is up; their liquidity is high; their balance sheets have come back; the loan officers survey indicates that they are getting a little more ready to lend money, and there are indications that that should continue.    On the demand side, there's a lot of anecdotal information that small and medium-size business credit demand is beginning to come back. We know that balance sheets have been restructuring generally across the board, and consumers have been very reluctant to borrow; they might come back.   So, it seems to me that we could well be seeing an incipient trend toward a better climate for credit extensions. There are some other things, too.   The dollar has been on the weak side. We may get a little better [performance of] net exports as a result of that. Consumer confidence is not high but it has been rising steadily, and it seems to me that it's very responsive to employment. And if we do get the good news on employment that I hope is going to come, then maybe that will give a further boost to consumer confidence. So, I think it's possible to build a rather plausible, rosy scenario here around employment growth and a thaw in credit conditions more than anything else.  I'm not buying into that wholeheartedly; there are too many negatives still out there to do that.  But I think the odds are improving that real activity is going to continue to improve. And there's a fair to good chance that we can hold policy where it is.  I certainly hope so because, if that's the case, I think that improves the chances [for continued expansion] for a while without our tightening too much as the economy strengthens.  And the  longer we can do that responsibly the better news there will be over the long haul. Governor Lindsey. Mr. Chairman, growing up I never thought I'd be an economist; I didn't know what an economist was.  I think my mother is still waiting for me to make something of my life and go to law school!  But I always liked math and I liked history and I found them together in economics.  And my first comment is on math. I don't think anyone thinks velocity is stable on a quarter- to-quarter basis.    In fact, on a distributional basis using the 120 quarters from 1961 to 1990, there is a 7-1/2 percent chance of velocity being more than 3 and an 18.3 percent chance of velocity being more than 2.    And if you use lagged velocity, I have a distributed lag function where the odds are even greater than that: 29.2 percent for having a velocity shock of more than 2 percent.    So, I think what we're seeing now is very much in line with historical averages on the up side. One need only to think back to the early 1980s.   I wasn't here, but I've looked at the numbers; there was a very strong negative velocity shock on the order of perhaps 2-1/2 or 3 percent a year.    So, I don't know if we really want to abandon velocity just because it's unstable on a quarter-to-quarter basis.     I agree with President Melzer's comment in fact that it's over long periods of time that M2 and the M2 velocity relationship are stable. Of course, that means that if we're going to have 4-1/2 percent nominal GDP growth and we have a year and a half of 2-1/2 percent M2 growth, that we should be equally comfortable with a year and a half of 6-1/2 percent M2 growth. If one is willing to let [M2 growth] go to 2 or 1-1/2 or 1 percent, one should also be willing to let it go to 7 or 7-1/2 or 8 percent for an equally long period of time on the other side. So, the real question is whether or not we want to use money as a policy variable in constraining [the economy].    The point is that velocity is stable over the long run, so we're going to have a bounceback. Indeed, all the explanations we've heard this morning suggest that that's the case. Don Kohn yesterday mentioned that if we include the yield curve we can explain perhaps a 1-1/2 point velocity shock.   I don't think anyone thinks the yield curve is going to remain as steep as it is now. It's going to bounce back and so will velocity. How about the flight from CDs?     Well, certainly, it isn't going to go on forever; eventually CDs would go down to zero and then [the decline] would have to stop.   My suspicion is that CDs probably will catch on at some point in the future and money will flow back into CDs.    So, again, we have to think about the fact that in the long term we have a stable relationship here.    M2 growth of 2-1/2 percent is not a long-term sustainable rate of growth. How long we want to tolerate it in the short run is something we might want to debate. But no one says that it's a short-term parameter. That's the math lesson. The history lesson is one that I was debating about, but my contrariness juices really got flowing.   I heard a wholesale abandonment of money here this morning and that takes three [forms]; (1) money doesn't matter; (2) banking weakness is also not a monetary phenomenon; and (3) that one [assesses] monetary ease by looking at interest rates and not money growth.   I happen to have these quotes from history; we've been here before.   As to the first that money  doesn't matter:   These events \\\"shattered the long-held belief, which had been strengthened during the 1920s, that monetary forces were important elements in the cyclical process and that monetary policy was a potent instrument for promoting economic stability. Opinion shifted almost to the opposite extreme, that 'money doesn't matter' that it's a passive factor which chiefly reflects the effects of other forces.\\\"   That was Friedman and Schwartz.  They went on to say that there was a tendency--this is again in the early '30s--to regard bank failures and contraction of deposits \\\"as regrettable consequences of bad management and bad banking practices or as inevitable reactions to prior speculative excesses,\\\"--Where have I heard that before--\\\"or as a consequence but hardly a cause of the financial and economic collapse\\\" of the time.   And finally, regarding nominal interest rates, a gentleman named Sprague who was a consultant to the Fed--and this was in February 1931--wrote that the Fed concluded that an aggressive easy money policy was practically out of the question in the United States \\\"for there is no general acceptance of view in this country that additional good loans and additional good investments are available at a lower rate of interest.\\\"   And continuing on the line that short-term nominal rates are a measure of policy, the Annual Report of the Fed in 1930 said:   \\\"The Federal Reserve pursued a policy of monetary ease\\\" in the last year.   In 1931 it said:  \\\"The credit policy of the Federal Reserve System in the first nine months was directed toward the furtherance of easy credit conditions, as indicated by further reductions in rates on discounts and acceptances.\\\"   And finally in 1932--this is over a period in which money shrank by a third-- \\\"Conditions in the open market for short-term money were relatively easy throughout the year and in the latter part money rates declined to exceptionally low levels.\\\"   We've been there before. My suspicion is, and my fear is, that we might be there again.   I certainly hope not. And finally, this is from the FOMC statement of October 1935 and suggests that inflation is always a fear we have:   \\\"The Committee cannot fail to recognize that the rapid growth of bank deposits and bank reserves in the past year and a half is building up a credit base which may be very difficult to control if undue credit expansion should become evident.\\\"   They were worried about it in 1935. With regard to existing conditions, clearly we're on a good path.  I'm not sure that an easing at this time is the right thing to do, but whenever I see the kind of wholesale abandonment of monetary aggregates that I heard this morning I get nervous.  So, I'd rather have the gun loaded, Mr. Chairman. Governor Phillips. Thank you. I think I'm bringing up the tail end again and I'll keep my comments short.   It seems that since I've been here we've been on the cusp of a recovery, trying to get a recovery going.   Certainly the signs on the real side are more positive this time; certainly that's what we've heard this morning.    I find myself being concerned about and questioning its strength and its sustainability.   Some of the sources of strength that we've been pointing to the last couple of months--housing and exports--seem to be fading a bit.   And I think it's interesting that no one has really talked today about some of the problems in the economy that we seem to have forgotten about.   The first one that I'd point to is the federal deficit, which I think is a continuing drag on the economy. We have talked about the state and local government shortfalls, and I've seen  a few tax increases coming out of some states but not a lot.  So, I think we're going to continue to see that as a drag on the economy. The major area of concern that I would point to--and I would magnify perhaps Dick Syron's [remark] with respect to its potential-- is consumer confidence, which seems to me to be very much tied into the labor market situation. I think the 7.2 percent unemployment rate perhaps understates some of the weakness in the labor market because of the pervasiveness of unemployment through a variety of occupations and the restructuring that is going on in industry.   This whole concept of underemployment and downward mobility is continuing to lengthen the period of time it's going to take us to get a real recovery going.   Certainly, on the money and credit aggregates, which we've talked about so I won't go into it, I'd agree with Larry:    I don't think we ought to abandon M2; we ought to look to see what it's saying at least in part.   On inflation, I am concerned that we're still seeing a bit higher inflation than we'd like.   I would have to say, however, that we need to expand our research on what zero inflation is.   I'm beginning to wonder if we're not getting closer to it than the traditional CPI measure or even the deflator would imply. On balance and in sum, I'm pleased that we're making some progress but the risk of another stall is certainly in the realm of possibilities. So, I think we should be alert to weakness on the real side. Thank you, governor. Jerry, I might interject for those who worry about money that from the third quarter of 1987 to the first quarter of 1992, M2 grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate even with all the weakness we've had recently. So, with 4 percent inflation we're looking at zero real M2 growth? Yes. Do you have our average target for that period? No, I don't. The average target would be more like 4-1/2 to 5 percent. [Coffee break] Not only did that note about the coffee say that the note was an hour and a half late, but I think the coffee probably arrived an hour and a half before the note! With that, I would like to call upon Mr. Kohn. [Statement--see Appendix.] Any questions for Mr. Kohn?  Mr. Chairman, this is in a sense a procedural question:   As I read the Bluebook and the projections for the monetary aggregates, particularly the alternatives, the time frame is from March and April to June.   I wonder if we wouldn't be better served in the policymaking decision to have a longer time frame extending beyond June for those projections.   We're practically at June now. I assume you have those [longer-term] projections, and it seems to me that it would be better to have a projection out perhaps to the fourth quarter. President Forrestal, if you look at paragraph 15 in the Bluebook, it gives a sense of where the aggregates might come out for the year--1/2 point more or less than for Alternative B with the selection of \\\"A\\\" or \\\"C.\\\"  We have been going for many, many years with this [procedure], but I agree with you. The reason that paragraph 15 is in the Bluebook is that the effect of anything done in the middle of May probably would be greater in July and August than it would be in May and June, so you do need to be thinking about that. Yes, I realize this is the way it has been done for a long time. I think there is another problem with that in the sense that if we introduce a longer-term time frame for money supply where it tends to override the targets that we came out with at the beginning of the year, what we're in danger of doing is having two forecasts.   It's essentially the targets on the one hand and a specific one on the other.   In general that might be fine if the second forecast is close to the middle of [the target range]; but if it is not, we're raising an interesting question about what it is we're trying to do.   It's almost as though we're trying to find a degree of accuracy that I think isn't even remotely possible.   I would be more inclined to the argument that we drop that forecast than extend it too far because our ability to forecast is awful. You raise an interesting question--maybe not facetiously--about dropping it. I would prefer to drop it. I have not given it any thought until this minute, but I ask:  What does it do for us?  What would happen if we were to drop it? Well, I think the issue would be how it feeds in. Perhaps it's an issue that really should be discussed in July because it's a question of having annual ranges and where the aggregates are [currently] relative to those ranges or whether you care where they are relative to the ranges.  If you were to drop the-- Could you draft us a memorandum? Could you circulate to the Committee the pros and the cons? Sure. Include President Forrestal's recommendation. That ought to be addressed. Certainly.  There are a lot of anachronisms sitting in our directive. Every time I read it I'm waiting for somebody somewhere to write a fun piece in some newspaper about the Federal Reserve directive!  I hope Bill Saffire of The New York Times doesn't get hold of that! How about Art Buchwald? Either one of them! You know, it's written as it would be written if we were going to publish it the next day. And as if we [know] all of the structural shifts in these relationships and how tight they are. Yes. He might also compile our estimating accuracy over the past few years! That's a mean thing to say! We do actually do that as an internal matter from time to time. Very internal! Any other questions for Don? Just a quick technical question. Don, you mentioned that the lags had to do with the tax payments and some of the other things that we think have distorted these [numbers].  Could you quantify the lags from the inside to the outside of the deposits? Well, on the taxes, I certainly expected the sort of snapback we saw.   [Our analysis suggested that] those checks would be clearing in late April and the first half of May-- Right. --and that's when one would expect to see a snapback [in money growth].   So, the fact that we had a $9 billion increase, or whatever it was, in M2 last week and that we have another increase in the $4 to $5 billion range coming for the week of May 11th is not surprising. And it's heavily in the M1 component, which is where the transactions money is, where you'd expect most though not all of the tax payments to be made.   So, I'd expect the tax [effect] to play out pretty much by the second half of May. The other [factors] I think are much harder to explain.  The [effect of] RTC activity is a bit contrary to common sense. We have always found, though, that there were some lags in that.   That is, RTC activity one and two months ago was having an effect on M2 growth this month. Now, I think that's partly because it does take a while:   peoples' depository relationships are disrupted; they get notices that their rates are reduced or a new bank has taken over and it takes them a while to react to that and to reconsider their portfolios.   So, perhaps it's not that contrary to common sense, but there is a little  lag there.   So, given the lack of RTC activity after about the second week of April or so, we probably will begin to feel that more in June and moving into the third quarter. And on the other one, the interest rate [effects], the lags are of course even longer so that they can play out over a longer period of time. We have by the way, President Forrestal, about 3-3/4 percent growth on a quarterly average basis projected under \\\"B\\\" for the third quarter and then 4-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter.   So, we would have a strengthening in the third quarter, presumably. Thank you. President Jordan. To catch up a bit with you on where you are compared to where you thought you were:  I don't know what you were looking at in terms of alternatives in your midyear review last year but you mentioned an easing in policy since last summer.  If at that time you had run your model contemplating a drop of 200 basis points in the funds rate over the next nine months, what would you have been projecting for the Committee in terms of monetary growth? I'm sure I would have been projecting several percentage points more than we had, but at the same time we did embody in the projections to the Committee last year and in February of this year an expectation of downward shifts in money demand. So, I don't think we would have been as far off as you might imagine just from feeding that [funds rate decline] through because we were aware at the time that things were out of kilter relative to the standard models. We allowed for that; last February we were predicting only 3-1/2 or 4 percent [M2] growth for 1992.   So, we had allowed all along for some slippage there. But I'm sure we would have been predicting probably about 2 percentage points more--maybe instead of 3-1/2 percent more like 5-1/2 percent for 1992--if you had told me in July that we were going to have 2 percentage points lower interest rates. With your past experience with the model, what is the probability you would assign of an offsetting error going forward?  Is that a tendency you have any confidence in? Well, there used to be, but I don't have much confidence in that right now given that we've had a string of about eight shortfalls in a row counting the second quarter of this year. A couple of years ago I would have said that I'd expect some offsetting errors and come out about right.  But I don't expect that now. We are not projecting an offsetting error in our projections of 3-1/2 percent for 1992 and 4 percent for 1993 for M2 growth consistent with the Greenbook GNP; we do not have offsetting errors built in. We have continued increases in velocity. We do have a fading out of some of the shift that's occurring; instead of continued downward shifts we have it fading out gradually. Okay, that answer suggests a one-time level adjustment on M2, a mirror image of what happened in 1983 when MMDAs were introduced. Right.  We got double-digit growth of M2 for about a year. We all recognized it as a shift of the level and then resumed [with] what a model [would predict] afterwards. Right. Is that the way you would characterize this period? Well, no, in the sense that in 1982 one could identify a specific deregulation event.  We knew the MMDAs were coming. We actually surveyed people to find out what they were shifting into NOW accounts and whatnot.  In one sense you're right: If the shifting stopped and it was just a level adjustment, that would be fine.  I'd have more confidence in that if I saw the shifting stop. But in an underlying economic sense, I think a very different kind of thing is going on. One can't identify it so strongly with an external deregulation or technology change as we had with Ml in the mid-1970s. It's something much deeper in the intermediation process and I think harder to analyze. President Stern. What's the sample period, Don, over which you estimate your standard model? I think it's about 1963 to 1986. Is that right, Dave? I think it goes up to 1988 now. It's the same model, however, that we used in the conference we had in 1987 on money demand. President Keehn. Don, in your comments about the structure of interest rates and the yield curve, I don't think I heard you say anything about the supply factor and the impact that has on rates.            Is that in your mind not an issue? Well, I think it's a smaller issue than expected in increases in real interest rates because of where we've driven short-term real rates and perhaps inflation as well.  I tend to discount it to a certain extent. On the supply, one thinks of not only government but even more particularly corporations and households shifting way out on the yield curve. On the other hand, we have had the households supplying the funds in some sense through shifts into bonds and mutual funds.  It probably had some effect but a small one relative to the other [factors], in my judgment. Governor Lindsey. Could I follow up on Jerry Jordan's question? At what point do you predict that the leveling off of velocity will occur?  Well, in terms of our models we actually have the demand shift pretty well dying out by next year. We do have an increase in velocity next year on the order of 1 percent.  We would view that partly as still a working down of some things like savings accounts and NOW accounts, in our models anyhow. And I think that will probably be true in real life as well.  Rates on some of these types of accounts, like NOW accounts and savings accounts, will continue to drop very slowly over an extended period of time in response to the lower rates.  So, we will have an increase in velocity next year but not really a money demand shift. Could we call that a continuing response to the steepness of the yield curve? No, that [effect] sort of dies out. The way the yield curve plays out in our model is that it is affecting [M2 growth] this year and is rather neutral for 1993.  It's not affecting it much one way or another. What happens when the yield curve starts to level out? Well, assuming that the CD rates then come into closer alignment with market rates and market rates level out, then I'd expect some reflows into M2. Any other questions for Don? On the question of resumed bank lending, have you taken much account of the risk-based deposit insurance as well as the risk-based capital coming into view? Only a little, I think. We implicitly had a sense that banks would not be actively pursuing deposits in order to make loans in part because the cost of making loans is going to be higher. We have not specifically factored in the risk-based premium.  We had, I believe, a notion that premiums would be higher; whether they would be risk-based or not is another issue.  That may be more an issue of distribution of loans throughout the banking system rather than the total. Further questions? If not, why don't I get started.  Listening to this general conversation, it creates a somewhat better outlook than I was perceiving as I walked into the room--not a great deal better, but enough to be somewhat noticeable. The general consensus around here, which is clearly supported by the data, is that the economy is moving forward on a fairly broad front but that nothing seems to be moving very quickly. There doesn't seem to be significant, outsized momentum in any sector, but it does seem to be gradual and pervasive across a fairly broad [spectrum]. The crucial question, however, is how fast [the expansion in the economy] really is.  I think the issue that Mike Prell raised with respect to the first-quarter GNP problems is a clear indication that there is something peculiar in our data system. There may be something to the argument that the payroll series could be more deficient this time than usual. The general argument that we all can make with respect to month-by-month changes in employment is that the  standard error of the employment change in the household series is very high.  It isn't all that high if you take a time frame of four, five, six, or seven months, average two or three months on one end and two or three months on the other, and calculate the standard error of that change; it's obviously very substantially lower.  So, it's hard to believe that with a sample of 60,000 [in the household series], with some historical parallelism to the payroll series, that the argument has to be that the payroll series is really being representative and that the man-hour data that are implicit in it are the best indicator for industrial production because, remember, industrial production is weaker than the GDP. Obviously, if we decided that the household payroll series was accurate and built up the gross domestic product side with those data, then the statistical discrepancy, which is the problem with the first quarter, would narrow very considerably. And, obviously, what you would get is a significant rise in the saving rate in the first quarter which, of course, is where the discrepancy change gets offset in the accounts. When you look at that, you ask if it is possible that the economy is really growing at 3-1/2 to 4 percent [and] that we have a saving rate which suggests that there is actually room for consumption to move faster than income; that is sort of a scenario that suggests there is more buoyancy in this outlook than the first-quarter data show. The truth of the matter is that I'm not sure anyone can judge that.   The anecdotal evidence raises questions as to whether the economy has anywhere near that type of momentum. Even though the orders data in manufacturing look somewhat better, they are not consistent with the type of significant rise in employment in manufacturing that one must presume would be part of the acceleration in household employment of the size or order of magnitude that we've been seeing in recent months.  I conclude that we're probably doing somewhat better in employment than the payroll series [indicates] but far short of the household series [increase] in that the economy in the first quarter was fairly good. The only question I would have with it is whether it is too much too soon in the sense that rather than going into the second quarter with inventory liquidation, we're going in with very modest liquidation and with upside momentum. If one looks at the data as they are materializing with respect to auto sales, starts, and the like, they don't suggest a really robust second quarter. It also looks as though we are financing this recovery very heavily internally.  If you look at the household sector, for example, there's very little borrowing. That essentially means that both gross asset expansion and gross liability expansion are very significantly below normal. That is another way of saying that M2, which is on the household asset side, is exceptionally slow and that the slow borrowing, with everyone financing internally, is an element of risk aversion. Clearly, that has also been the case, although I suspect to an increasingly lesser extent in the corporate sector where one must presume, if these numbers are correct, that a very significant increase in cash flow is going on and that even though we have some fairly heavy borrowing externally a very large amount of financing with internal funds is going on pretty much as usual. So, this is in a way an odd sort of recovery, one that we've discussed at length in connection with the question of balance sheet repair, which is another way of saying that a significant amount of  cash flow is going to pay off debt rather than going to the consumption of goods and services or investment. The outlook does not seem to have changed significantly from the last time we were here when there appeared to be some form of financial ceiling on the economy basically represented by the balance sheet pressures and essentially reflected in the fact that every time the economy seems to pick up, long-term interest rates seem to go up.  What we have learned apparently is that that is having an effect on a number of areas, very specifically on the housing area, which leads me to conclude--pretty much as I have been concluding since the beginning of the year--that the crucial statistic in the outlook is nominal long-term interest rates.  To the extent that they have a significant effect in the housing market and the turnover of mortgages, refinancing, they have been a critical factor in the general forward thrust of the economy. I think we're also learning that the inclination at the long end of the market for rates to move lower with lower federal funds rates is increasingly dubious.  While I must say that I can't give a persuasive analytical argument at this particular stage, I nonetheless would be willing to put money on the table that moving the fed funds rate lower right now would not bring a lower long-term bond yield. However, that may not continue to be the case. As a consequence of that, I would be disinclined to try to move the funds rate lower now, but if it turns out that at some point it begins to look as though we might be able to prod the long-term rate lower were we to move the funds rate, I personally would be more inclined in that direction. Frankly, my overall view is that we are probably more likely as a Committee to be moving to lower rates than to higher rates in the next several months. The next move is more likely to be down than up, but I don't think the odds are skewed enough in that direction to argue in favor of an asymmetric directive. I must admit that I don't have any strong feelings personally either way.  I would be somewhat inclined toward symmetry if for no other reason than that in listening to the tone of the individual District discussions, things are somewhat better than I would have suspected; but I could live with an asymmetric directive. In either case, I would argue that we should adopt alternative B.  I would prefer symmetric but could very easily go with asymmetric if that's what the Committee wants.  President Parry. Mr. Chairman, I would strongly support your recommendation.  It seems to me quite likely that the economy could be growing at a rate of 3 percent over the next six quarters.  At the same time, all of our forecasts are showing that inflation is not going to show significant improvement.  In that kind of environment and with those kinds of prospects, I think it would be very desirable not to change policy and also to have a symmetrical directive.  I might also point out that if we get a very significant upward revision of those first-quarter data and the next thing that hits the financial market is the fact that we had an asymmetric toward ease directive, I don't think that would be received very favorably in the financial markets at all.  So, I believe the case for a symmetric directive is quite strong. Thank you. Governor Angell. Mr. Chairman, I could support an asymmetric directive if it were toward tightness and I could accommodate myself  to a symmetric directive as you have suggested.  It seems to me that we do encounter some likelihood over the coming period that the fed funds rate might need to be closer to 5 percent than to 3-3/4 percent; and money growth, M2, right now doesn't give us any leeway to make that move at this point in time. So, symmetric will work for me.    But I just wanted you to know my leanings and also my inability to support the asymmetric direction. President Forrestal. I would support alternative B with a symmetric directive. Governor Kelley. I support alternative B with a symmetric directive. Governor Lindsey. Mr. Chairman, I understand from your logic that we should keep our options open. That is a very compelling case. One of the first things I learned at my first [Committee] meeting was that the \\\"would/mights\\\" were not an insect but in fact inhabit our monetary halls.  This sounds to me as not a \\\"would/might\\\" situation but a \\\"would/would\\\" situation.  I think we want a symmetric directive but want to keep our options open to indicate that we [are prepared] to respond to economic data.  So, in stating my opinion, perhaps I'm asking a question:  Does your suggestion for symmetry mean a \\\"would/would\\\" directive or a \\\"might/might\\\" directive? I don't have a clue! Then I would recommend the \\\"would/would\\\" as an approach if we want symmetry. Let me say this: I will be disinclined, frankly, to support moving lower unless we see some real signs that this [recovery] is starting to stall out. And I'd need a little more than just a vague notion; I'd need a set of data suggesting a cumulative process that in my judgment probably would incline this Committee toward moving lower even from a symmetric directive. But I would be a little cautious if we kept seeing a steady economic recovery and M2 looked awfully weak. I would conclude from that that we have more of a problem with M2 than we have with the economy. But if we saw both beginning to look rather shabby, then I think it would be incumbent on us to move lower.  I would also say that should we get a change in the economic environment, it would be appropriate for us to have a telephone conference and discuss it because, if there is a real change in the economic environment, the group around this table collectively would have a good sense of that.  If there seemed to be some evidence that this recovery was faltering and it were not confirmed in the individual Districts, I would question the data. So, even though I'm saying we should keep our options open, I do think we ought to be cautious about moving too quickly unless the evidence really begins to mount. This is a very unusual set of circumstances and a type of period where we could make the kind of mistakes that  monetary policy often makes at the bottom of the cycle.      I don't know whether that's \\\"would/would\\\" or \\\"might/might.\\\" The Secretary's view is that \\\"might\\\" captures that thought better than \\\"would.\\\" President Stern. Well, following on your last comment, Mr. Chairman, I too favor \\\"B,\\\" symmetric.   In part, I think we have to be careful not to respond to what we already know--the sense that we continue to look at a modest recovery by historic standards. Presumably, that's what we expect. We continue to expect for the next six weeks anyway to look at pretty sluggish M2 expansion; that's what the Bluebook expects at least.   If that isn't acceptable, we ought to want to change policy. With regard to M2, since I didn't weigh in earlier, I might try to muddy the waters a little further right now. Governor Lindsey's point about the volatility of M2 velocity in the short run is undoubtedly correct.   I recall that we ran some simulations several years ago that said that if we really wanted to apply fairly rigorous confidence intervals to the annual M2 targets, then the ranges shouldn't be 3 or 4 percentage points wide; they really had to be 6 to 8 percentage points wide if we wanted to be reasonably confident of achieving them. That tells you that there's a lot of short-run volatility in velocity. As to whether M2 is going to or has to bounce back at some point, I must admit I'm getting increasingly skeptical.   I think we may need to devote a little more time to that question and the role of that aggregate.   If I think about what has transpired recently and what is different, it seems to me that customers of depository institutions today--customers broadly defined--clearly face a wider range of choices than they did certainly 10 or 20 years ago, the time encompassed in the estimation period of these models.  Clearly, banks and other institutions face a much wider range of choices when it comes to pricing and other policies than they did 10 or 20 years ago.  And we're also operating for the most part in a lower interest rate environment than we have over a sustained period of time. Maybe we have to go back to the '60s to find something like this, at least for short rates.   So, as I think about all that, it's not clear to me that there's going to be some automatic correction in M2 or indeed that a correction in M2 is desirable in these circumstances.  A lot has changed. Banks have disappeared; depository institutions have disappeared. The way we measure some or most of M2 almost surely-- Right. It's an interesting question: When does this long-term trend we are all forecasting begin to affect the M2 data? Congress is working on it! [Laughter] Since you have the floor, Governor LaWare, why don't you stay with it.  Well, for all the reasons cited in my earlier sermon, I support your recommendation of \\\"B\\\" symmetric although I would like to identify myself with Governor Angell's preference for asymmetric toward restraint. President Jordan. I always have to translate what I think it really means when people talk in terms of raising and lowering the funds rate in the sense of tightening and easing policy.  I've come to understand that easing in the sense of the funds rate doesn't mean we are more stimulative necessarily and raising the funds rate doesn't mean we are more restrictive.  We have difficulties [not only] in communicating [that] outside this room, but translating it inside. I was pleased that Governor Lindsey mentioned the 1930s in that context of easing and tightening because otherwise I would have been shy about mentioning something that relates to 60 years ago.    I read that period a little differently in that, first of all, asset prices historically have always risen in advance of output prices and the reverse, taking the stock market as the measure of asset prices. And, of course, in that earlier period asset prices were falling very sharply; and it turned out to be a good indicator of what was going to be happening to output prices, deflation. Governor Lindsey mentioned how money shrank by one-third in that period as interest rates fell, so was policy tighter or easier?   I think it was tight.  The money measure, though, was a very narrow measure, even narrower than today's published Ml.   And today the very narrow measures, i.e., reserves, Ml, [unintelligible] are growing extraordinarily rapidly. And I think we interpret those as biasing our actions in the direction of stimulus to the point that, if credit demand grows and short-term rates are under upward pressure, a higher funds rate would be interpreted as a tighter policy. I would view it as stimulative if we were lagging behind the market.   I think there is a risk going forward as the economy gains momentum that we could lag behind the market and our actions would be stimulative while raising the funds rate would have the label \\\"tight\\\" on it.   If we should get a good rally in the bond market--something I hope very, very much for--and a flattening [of the yield curve] from the long end, and if that should carry with it downward pressure on the bill rate on a full-coupon equivalent basis toward a level well below the funds rate, then I think it would be appropriate to lower the funds rate and not hold it up artificially.   If the bill rate were rallying down we would have to drain reserves and contract monetary growth, and I wouldn't like to see that.   So, I come down on the side of symmetric with a bias in the direction of up, especially promptly up, if credit demands so warrant. President Keehn. Mr. Chairman, I was right with you absolutely all the way as you went through your analysis right up until the end.  I must say that although the general tone of the comments seems more positive now than it was the last time, I do think there are some unusual factors here. And I continue to think that the risks on economic growth are on the down side.  You said, and I certainly agree, that in the near term we are more likely to ease than we are to tighten. Therefore, it seems to me that the directive ought to  reflect those possibilities. As a consequence, I'd be in favor of \\\"B,\\\" but I'd continue with asymmetric language. President Melzer. I'd favor \\\"B\\\" asymmetric toward tightening. I think we've had a stimulative policy in place, no matter how you look at it, for a long period of time. And, at a minimum, that's consistent with recovery and expansion. Consistent with what Jerry was saying, I also think there's a risk as this expansion progresses that our policy, in terms of interest rates, is likely to be inconsistent with progress toward price stability. We ought to be mindful of that.  I was quite comfortable with what you said in responding to Governor Lindsey, Alan.  Your earlier comments about perhaps seeing an opportunity to coax long rates lower worried me a little. That may be possible at points in time, but I think it's very risky business at the level of short-term real rates we have right now and could well backfire, for what that's worth. Finally, I could live with your prescription of \\\"B\\\" symmetrical but I'd prefer \\\"B\\\" asymmetrical toward tightening. President Boehne. I think your proposition is reasonable and I support it.  I must say that it's hard for me to imagine a set of circumstances that would be convincing to tighten policy in the next five or six weeks, given where the economy has been and where it is likely to go and all the uncertainties about the money supply. Maybe [that view] reflects the fact that Philadelphia is in the northeast part of the country. President McTeer. I would support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman. President Black. \\\"B\\\" symmetric, Mr. Chairman, with your clarification about your reluctance to move in either direction unless we had some confirmation in the real economy as well as the aggregates. I think you're dead right on that and I was going to throw that [comment] out had you not done it ahead of me.   Another thing we need to address is this alternative sentence proposed for the directive. That sentence indicates we are expecting at least a moderate resumption of expansion in the aggregates, and I'd like to see that in there rather than the old sentence that we had. The reason for it, obviously, is that the original procedure would have given us an odd statement. President Syron. I support \\\"B\\\" symmetric. I hope we need to tighten before the next meeting; I doubt it.  Coming back to language, on this whole issue of symmetry I remember long debates about \\\"would/coulds\\\" and \\\"could/woulds,\\\" and I find it very hard to get excited one way or the other about a consonant.   So, in that regard, I would go along with what you suggested.  Governor Mullins. Well, using Jerry Jordan's model, I would have to prefer asymmetric toward ease with the T-bill rate well below the fed funds rate. With that model I wonder a bit how we get a clear view of what the Treasury bill rate really is other than a prediction of what we're likely to do next. And I do agree in general with the notion that we are going to have to think very carefully about real rates as we go through this process.  However, I simply don't see the loan demand picking up again. And I don't think it's just M2; it's total debt, as the Chairman mentioned, as well.  So, I would prefer asymmetric toward ease in this environment but I would support symmetric along with the stance of monitoring developments as we roar through this 2 percent quarter!  [Laughter] President Hoenig. Mr. Chairman, I certainly would support \\\"B.\\\" As far as symmetric or asymmetric, my preference would be toward asymmetric.   I may have heard some good things about the real economy, but I don't consider it all that much stronger than where we were some months ago when we were talking about being willing to live with money growth above the midpoint. And now suddenly we're very satisfied with it being at the bottom [of the range] and are satisfied that [it will be sufficient] to carry us forward. We're now relying on an accelerating velocity that we really can't predict.   I don't see that there is all that much strength going forward.   But I certainly can live with symmetric language given that we would have a consultation if there's other news coming forward. Vice Chairman. \\\"B\\\" symmetric is fine with me. And just a quick footnote:  I don't know when we'll have to tighten; it could be soon; it could be later. But I'll tell you this:   If that judgment is reached in a context in which M2 is still on the floor, it's going to present a mighty tricky issue in terms of formulating the logic and the public relations to go with it.  And it's quite possible that that could happen. I know what the solution to that is. Give the job to Don Kohn to get a new set of Ms! Although I will say this:  Unless it's very close by, that would certainly indicate that M2 is really very far off target. I was quite sympathetic with President Hoenig's remarks about how we were talking about M2 earlier. Right. In the last six weeks to two months I have been somewhat dismayed by what has been happening to M2 on the grounds that it has been a very useful indicator for us.  And I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that something is wrong with the measure.  As I indicated before, whenever you get a measure [that previously] explained several different things like the P*/price relationship, the income/velocity relationship, the relationship of balance sheets, and all those things [the issue is whether] you could just draw a new line and everything would fall back into place.   It  really raises a question as to whether it's the single     [measure] that's out of line with everything else. Mr. Chairman, there is active staff work not only here but at the Reserve Banks looking at different measures, and it will be a topic on the agenda at the Financial Analysis Committee meeting in St. Louis in June; there is at least one paper on that. Finally, Governor Phillips. I would prefer \\\"B\\\" asymmetric toward ease, but I'll support symmetric recognizing that we may have to talk again in the intermeeting period. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I asked a question but I never stated my view.   I'd just like to indicate my preference for the record, especially since I see that my colleague to my left has me down as favoring symmetric. My preference would be for asymmetric. I had put down that your preference is asymmetric. Okay. Asymmetric in which direction? [Laughter] He's asymmetric to you! I tried to get a view of the Committee, and it's very clearly heavily asymmetric toward symmetric.  [Laughter] Let me say this.  I think that Don's recommendation with respect to the alternate sentence really makes a good deal of sense.  Unless I hear an objection-- Could you tell us where to turn to read that sentence, please? At the bottom of page 15 in the Bluebook. I'm sorry, Chairman Greenspan: \\\"Contemplated reserves conditions...\\\" The very bottom of page 15. I would write in there 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent; I don't like writing 1/4 percent on growth targets. Does anybody have any objections to the insertion of Don's recommended language? I understand the \\\"might\\\" but do you want \\\"somewhat\\\" on both sides? We have not gotten there yet. We're on the very last sentence, the bracketed sentence. Mr. Chairman, if the numbers are 2-1/2 and  1-1/2 percent, I'd question the word \\\"resumption.\\\"       Are we talking about a resumption to 2-1/2? Well, that's a good point. No. You're right. This doesn't make a lot of sense. With a resumption of growth in M2-- It shows our problem. We don't have growth in M2, so I suppose we are open for a resumption. We might take out the words \\\"a resumption of.\\\" So the phrasing would be? \\\"With growth of...\\\" Agreed without objection. Will the Secretary read the language? \\\"In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.   The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from April to June at annual rates of about 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent, respectively.\\\" Would you call the roll?

        "Para establecer un modelo de referencia (baseline) en este problema de clasificación multiclase (predecir si la tasa de interés sube `1`, baja `-1` o se mantiene `0`), se ha seleccionado el algoritmo de **Regresión Logística**. La elección se fundamenta en los siguientes puntos clave, alineados con las mejores prácticas para la creación de un baseline:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Interpretabilidad:** Al ser un modelo lineal, la Regresión Logística es altamente interpretable. Los coeficientes asignados a cada característica nos permiten entender qué palabras (del TF-IDF) y qué variables numéricas tienen un mayor impacto en la probabilidad de que la tasa suba o baje. Esto es fundamental para un primer análisis y para cumplir con el criterio de \"Características importantes\".\n",
        "* **Eficiencia:** Es un algoritmo computacionalmente eficiente, rápido de entrenar incluso con un gran número de características (más de 224,000 en nuestro caso, provenientes de la matriz TF-IDF). Esto permite una iteración y evaluación ágil.\n",
        "* **Rendimiento Sólido como Baseline:** La Regresión Logística es un estándar en problemas de clasificación de texto y a menudo ofrece un rendimiento sorprendentemente bueno que sirve como un excelente punto de comparación para modelos más complejos (como redes neuronales o ensambles de árboles).\n",
        "* **Manejo de Datos Mixtos:** Funciona eficazmente con la combinación de datos dispersos (la matriz TF-IDF del texto) y datos densos (las características numéricas que hemos diseñado), que es exactamente la estructura de nuestros datos de entrada.\n",
        "\n",
        "Se utilizará la implementación de `sklearn` con el solver `\"saga\"`, que es eficiente para datasets grandes y permite regularización L2 para prevenir el sobreajuste. Además, se usará el parámetro `class_weight=\"balanced\"` para que el modelo preste la debida atención a las clases minoritarias (subidas y bajadas de tasas), que son menos frecuentes pero de gran importancia para el negocio."

        "\n",
        "El problema de negocio consiste en predecir la dirección del cambio en las tasas de interés, un problema de clasificación con clases inherentemente desbalanceadas: la decisión de \"mantener\" la tasa (clase `0`) es mucho más frecuente que \"subir\" (`1`) o \"bajar\" (`-1`).\n",

        "* **Insuficiencia del Accuracy:** En este escenario, el *accuracy* (precisión global) es una métrica engañosa. Un modelo simple que siempre prediga la clase mayoritaria (\"mantener\") obtendría un *accuracy* alto, pero fallaría en el objetivo principal del negocio, que es anticipar los cambios.\n",
        "* **Ventaja del F1-Score:** El F1-Score es la media armónica de la **precisión** y el **recall**. Es robusto ante el desbalance de clases.\n",
        "* **¿Por qué ponderado (Weighted)?** Se elige la versión \"ponderada\" porque da más importancia a la clase con más instancias. Para un baseline, esto refleja un objetivo de negocio conservador: tener un buen rendimiento general.\n",

        "### **Conclusión General del Avance 3**\n",
        "\n",
        "En este avance, se ha construido y evaluado un modelo de referencia (*baseline*) para el problema de clasificación de la dirección de las tasas de interés, cumpliendo con los objetivos de establecer medidas de calidad y proporcionar un marco para la evaluación de modelos futuros.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Resumen de Hallazgos:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Modelo Baseline (Regresión Logística):** Se eligió la Regresión Logística por su interpretabilidad, eficiencia y robustez como punto de partida. El modelo fue entrenado utilizando una combinación de características textuales (TF-IDF) y numéricas extraídas de las transcripciones.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Métrica de Negocio (F1-Score Ponderado):** Se determinó que el **F1-Score Ponderado (0.72)** es la métrica más adecuada debido al desbalance de clases en el objetivo. Esta métrica ofrece una evaluación más fiable del rendimiento del modelo que el *accuracy*.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Viabilidad del Problema:** El desempeño del modelo baseline (`F1-Score: 0.72`) supera significativamente al de modelos nulos que predicen la clase más frecuente (`0.54`) o de forma aleatoria (`0.49`). Esto **confirma la viabilidad del problema**: los datos contienen información suficiente para predecir la variable objetivo con un rendimiento considerablemente mejor que el azar, estableciendo una solución mínima aceptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Características Relevantes:** El análisis de los coeficientes del modelo (método embebido) reveló los términos y variables más influyentes. Se observó que palabras como `\"septiembre\"`, `\"crisis\"` y `\"recuperación\"` tienen un impacto significativo, al igual que variables numéricas como la cantidad de tokens (`num_tokens`) y el conteo de entidades. Esta interpretabilidad es uno de los mayores valores del modelo baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Diagnóstico del Modelo (Sobreajuste):** El análisis de las curvas de aprendizaje y la diferencia entre el *accuracy* de entrenamiento (`97%`) y de prueba (`72%`) demostraron claramente que el modelo presenta **sobreajuste**. Ha aprendido muy bien los patrones específicos de los datos de entrenamiento, pero le cuesta generalizar a datos nuevos.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Marco de Referencia y Próximos Pasos:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Este modelo baseline ha sentado las bases para el desarrollo de soluciones más avanzadas. Los próximos pasos se centrarán en dos áreas principales:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Mitigación del Sobreajuste:** Se explorarán técnicas como un ajuste más fino de la regularización (parámetro `C`), selección de características más robusta (para reducir el ruido de la matriz TF-IDF) o técnicas de reducción de dimensionalidad como PCA o SVD.\n",
        "* **Modelos Más Avanzados:** Con el baseline como referencia, se evaluarán modelos más complejos como `XGBoost`, `LightGBM` o redes neuronales (tipo `LSTM` o `Transformers`) que podrían capturar relaciones no lineales en los datos y potencialmente ofrecer un mejor rendimiento de generalización. Cualquier modelo futuro deberá superar el F1-Score de `0.72` para ser considerado una mejora sustancial.\n",
        "\n",
        "En definitiva, este avance no solo entrega un modelo funcional, sino un diagnóstico completo que define claramente el camino a seguir para la mejora continua del proyecto."
